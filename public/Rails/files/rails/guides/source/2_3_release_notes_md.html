<h1 id="label-Ruby+on+Rails+2.3+Release+Notes">Ruby on <a href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> 2.3 Release Notes</h1>

<p><a href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> 2.3 delivers a variety
of new and improved features, including pervasive <a
href="../../../../classes/Rack.html">Rack</a> integration, refreshed
support for <a href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> Engines,
nested transactions for Active Record, dynamic and default scopes, unified
rendering, more efficient routing, application templates, and quiet
backtraces. This list covers the major upgrades, but doesn&#39;t include
every little bug fix and change. If you want to see everything, check out
the <a href="http://github.com/rails/rails/commits/master">list of
commits</a> in the main <a href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a>
repository on GitHub or review the <code>CHANGELOG</code> files for the
individual <a href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> components.</p>
<hr style="height: 1px">

<h2 id="label-Application+Architecture">Application Architecture</h2>

<p>There are two major changes in the architecture of <a
href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> applications: complete
integration of the <a href="http://rack.rubyforge.org/">Rack</a> modular
web server interface, and renewed support for <a
href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> Engines.</p>

<h3 id="label-Rack+Integration"><a href="../../../../classes/Rack.html">Rack</a> Integration</h3>

<p><a href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> has now broken with its
CGI past, and uses <a href="../../../../classes/Rack.html">Rack</a>
everywhere. This required and resulted in a tremendous number of internal
changes (but if you use CGI, don&#39;t worry; <a
href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> now supports CGI through a
proxy interface.) Still, this is a major change to <a
href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> internals. After upgrading
to 2.3, you should test on your local environment and your production
environment. Some things to test:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Sessions</p>
</li><li>
<p>Cookies</p>
</li><li>
<p><a href="../../../../classes/File.html">File</a> uploads</p>
</li><li>
<p>JSON/XML APIs</p>
</li></ul>

<p>Here&#39;s a summary of the rack-related changes:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><code>script/server</code> has been switched to use <a
href="../../../../classes/Rack.html">Rack</a>, which means it supports any
<a href="../../../../classes/Rack.html">Rack</a> compatible server.
<code>script/server</code> will also pick up a rackup configuration file if
one exists. By default, it will look for a <code>config.ru</code> file, but
you can override this with the <code>-c</code> switch.</p>
</li><li>
<p>The FCGI handler goes through <a
href="../../../../classes/Rack.html">Rack</a>.</p>
</li><li>
<p><code>ActionController::Dispatcher</code> maintains its own default
middleware stack. Middlewares can be injected in, reordered, and removed.
The stack is compiled into a chain on boot. You can configure the
middleware stack in <code>environment.rb</code>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>The <code>rake middleware</code> task has been added to inspect the
middleware stack. This is useful for debugging the order of the middleware
stack.</p>
</li><li>
<p>The integration test runner has been modified to execute the entire
middleware and application stack. This makes integration tests perfect for
testing <a href="../../../../classes/Rack.html">Rack</a> middleware.</p>
</li><li>
<p><code>ActionController::CGIHandler</code> is a backwards compatible CGI
wrapper around <a href="../../../../classes/Rack.html">Rack</a>. The
<code>CGIHandler</code> is meant to take an old CGI object and convert its
environment information into a <a
href="../../../../classes/Rack.html">Rack</a> compatible form.</p>
</li><li>
<p><code>CgiRequest</code> and <code>CgiResponse</code> have been removed.</p>
</li><li>
<p><a href="../../../../classes/Session.html">Session</a> stores are now lazy
loaded. If you never access the session object during a request, it will
never attempt to load the session data (parse the cookie, load the data
from memcache, or lookup an Active Record object).</p>
</li><li>
<p>You no longer need to use <code>CGI::Cookie.new</code> in your tests for
setting a cookie value. Assigning a <code>String</code> value to <a
href="http://"foo"">request.cookies</a> now sets the cookie as expected.</p>
</li><li>
<p><code>CGI::Session::CookieStore</code> has been replaced by
<code>ActionController::Session::CookieStore</code>.</p>
</li><li>
<p><code>CGI::Session::MemCacheStore</code> has been replaced by
<code>ActionController::Session::MemCacheStore</code>.</p>
</li><li>
<p><code>CGI::Session::ActiveRecordStore</code> has been replaced by
<code>ActiveRecord::SessionStore</code>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>You can still change your session store with
<code>ActionController::Base.session_store = :active_record_store</code>.</p>
</li><li>
<p><a href="../../../../classes/Default.html">Default</a> sessions options are
still set with <code>ActionController::Base.session = { :key =&gt;
&quot;...&quot; }</code>. However, the <code>:session_domain</code> option
has been renamed to <code>:domain</code>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>The mutex that normally wraps your entire request has been moved into
middleware, <code>ActionController::Lock</code>.</p>
</li><li>
<p><code>ActionController::AbstractRequest</code> and
<code>ActionController::Request</code> have been unified. The new
<code>ActionController::Request</code> inherits from
<code>Rack::Request</code>. This affects access to
<code>response.headers['type']</code> in test requests. Use
<code>response.content_type</code> instead.</p>
</li><li>
<p><code>ActiveRecord::QueryCache</code> middleware is automatically inserted
onto the middleware stack if <code>ActiveRecord</code> has been loaded.
This middleware sets up and flushes the per-request Active Record query
cache.</p>
</li><li>
<p>The <a href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> router and
controller classes follow the <a
href="../../../../classes/Rack.html">Rack</a> spec. You can call a
controller directly with <code>SomeController.call(env)</code>. The router
stores the routing parameters in <code>rack.routing_args</code>.</p>
</li><li>
<p><code>ActionController::Request</code> inherits from
<code>Rack::Request</code>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Instead of <code>config.action_controller.session = { :session_key =&gt;
&#39;foo&#39;, ...</code> use <code>config.action_controller.session = {
:key =&gt; &#39;foo&#39;, ...</code>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Using the <code>ParamsParser</code> middleware preprocesses any XML, JSON,
or YAML requests so they can be read normally with any
<code>Rack::Request</code> object after it.</p>
</li></ul>

<h3 id="label-Renewed+Support+for+Rails+Engines">Renewed Support for <a href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> Engines</h3>

<p>After some versions without an upgrade, <a
href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> 2.3 offers some new
features for <a href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> Engines
(Rails applications that can be embedded within other applications). First,
routing files in engines are automatically loaded and reloaded now, just
like your <code>routes.rb</code> file (this also applies to routing files
in other plugins). Second, if your plugin has an app folder, then <a
href="http://models|controllers|helpers">app/</a> will automatically be
added to the <a href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> load path.
Engines also support adding view paths now, and Action Mailer as well as
Action View will use views from engines and other plugins.</p>

<h2 id="label-Documentation">Documentation</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails guides</a>
project has published several additional guides for <a
href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> 2.3. In addition, a <a
href="http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/">separate site</a> maintains
updated copies of the Guides for <a
href="../../../../classes/Edge.html">Edge</a> <a
href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a>. Other documentation
efforts include a relaunch of the <a
href="http://newwiki.rubyonrails.org/">Rails wiki</a> and early planning
for a <a href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> <a
href="../../../../classes/Book.html">Book</a>.</p>

</li></ul>

<h2 id="label-Ruby+1.9.1+Support">Ruby 1.9.1 Support</h2>

<p><a href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> 2.3 should pass all of
its own tests whether you are running on Ruby 1.8 or the now-released Ruby
1.9.1. You should be aware, though, that moving to 1.9.1 entails checking
all of the data adapters, plugins, and other code that you depend on for
Ruby 1.9.1 compatibility, as well as <a
href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> core.</p>

<h2 id="label-Active+Record">Active Record</h2>

<p>Active Record gets quite a number of new features and bug fixes in <a
href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> 2.3. The highlights include
nested attributes, nested transactions, dynamic and default scopes, and
batch processing.</p>

<h3 id="label-Nested+Attributes"><a href="../../../../classes/Nested.html">Nested</a> Attributes</h3>

<p>Active Record can now update the attributes on nested models directly,
provided you tell it to do so:</p>

<pre><code>class Book &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  has_one :author
  has_many :pages

  accepts_nested_attributes_for :author, :pages
end
</code></pre>

<p>Turning on nested attributes enables a number of things: automatic (and
atomic) saving of a record together with its associated children,
child-aware validations, and support for nested forms (discussed later).</p>

<p>You can also specify requirements for any new records that are added via
nested attributes using the <code>:reject_if</code> option:</p>

<pre><code>accepts_nested_attributes_for :author,
  :reject_if =&gt; proc { |attributes| attributes[&#39;name&#39;].blank? }
</code></pre>

Model Forms</a></p>
</li></ul>

<h3 id="label-Nested+Transactions"><a href="../../../../classes/Nested.html">Nested</a> Transactions</h3>

<p>Active Record now supports nested transactions, a much-requested feature.
Now you can write code like this:</p>

<pre><code>User.transaction do
  User.create(:username =&gt; &#39;Admin&#39;)
  User.transaction(:requires_new =&gt; true) do
    User.create(:username =&gt; &#39;Regular&#39;)
    raise ActiveRecord::Rollback
  end
end

User.find(:all)  # =&gt; Returns only Admin
</code></pre>

<p><a href="../../../../classes/Nested.html">Nested</a> transactions let you
roll back an inner transaction without affecting the state of the outer
transaction. If you want a transaction to be nested, you must explicitly
add the <code>:requires_new</code> option; otherwise, a nested transaction
simply becomes part of the parent transaction (as it does currently on <a
href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> 2.2). Under the covers,
nested transactions are <a
href="http://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/tickets/383,">using
savepoints</a> so they&#39;re supported even on databases that don&#39;t
have true nested transactions. There is also a bit of magic going on to
make these transactions play well with transactional fixtures during
testing.</p>

Viney</a> and <a href="http://izumi.plan99.net/blog/">Hongli Lai</a></p>
</li></ul>

<h3 id="label-Dynamic+Scopes">Dynamic Scopes</h3>

<p>You know about dynamic finders in <a
href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> (which allow you to concoct
methods like <code>find_by_color_and_flavor</code> on the fly) and named
scopes (which allow you to encapsulate reusable query conditions into
friendly names like <code>currently_active</code>). Well, now you can have
dynamic scope methods. The idea is to put together syntax that allows
filtering on the fly <em>and</em> method chaining. For example:</p>

<pre><code>Order.scoped_by_customer_id(12)
Order.scoped_by_customer_id(12).find(:all,
  :conditions =&gt; &quot;status = &#39;open&#39;&quot;)
Order.scoped_by_customer_id(12).scoped_by_status(&quot;open&quot;)
</code></pre>

<p>There&#39;s nothing to define to use dynamic scopes: they just work.</p>

</li></ul>

<h3 id="label-Default+Scopes"><a href="../../../../classes/Default.html">Default</a> Scopes</h3>

<p><a href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> 2.3 will introduce the
notion of <em>default scopes</em> similar to named scopes, but applying to
all named scopes or find methods within the model. For example, you can
write <code>default_scope :order =&gt; &#39;name ASC&#39;</code> and any
time you retrieve records from that model they&#39;ll come out sorted by
name (unless you override the option, of course).</p>

New in Edge Rails: Default Scoping</a></p>
</li></ul>

<h3 id="label-Batch+Processing">Batch Processing</h3>

<p>You can now process large numbers of records from an <a
href="../../../../classes/ActiveRecord.html">ActiveRecord</a> model with
less pressure on memory by using <code>find_in_batches</code>:</p>

<pre><code>Customer.find_in_batches(:conditions =&gt; {:active =&gt; true}) do |customer_group|
  customer_group.each { |customer| customer.update_account_balance! }
end
</code></pre>

<p>You can pass most of the <code>find</code> options into
<code>find_in_batches</code>. However, you cannot specify the order that
records will be returned in (they will always be returned in ascending
order of primary key, which must be an integer), or use the
<code>:limit</code> option. Instead, use the <code>:batch_size</code>
option, which defaults to 1000, to set the number of records that will be
returned in each batch.</p>

<p>The new <code>find_each</code> method provides a wrapper around
<code>find_in_batches</code> that returns individual records, with the find
itself being done in batches (of 1000 by default):</p>

<pre><code>Customer.find_each do |customer|
  customer.update_account_balance!
end
</code></pre>

<p>Note that you should only use this method for batch processing: for small
numbers of records (less than 1000), you should just use the regular find
methods with your own loop.</p>

<code>each</code>):</p>

</li></ul>
</li></ul>

<h3 id="label-Multiple+Conditions+for+Callbacks">Multiple Conditions for Callbacks</h3>

<p>When using Active Record callbacks, you can now combine <code>:if</code>
and <code>:unless</code> options on the same callback, and supply multiple
conditions as an array:</p>

<pre><code>before_save :update_credit_rating, :if =&gt; :active,
  :unless =&gt; [:admin, :cash_only]
</code></pre>
<ul><li>
<p>Lead Contributor: L. Caviola</p>
</li></ul>

<h3 id="label-Find+with+having">Find with having</h3>

<p><a href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> now has a
<code>:having</code> option on find (as well as on <code>has_many</code>
and <code>has_and_belongs_to_many</code> associations) for filtering
records in grouped finds. As those with heavy SQL backgrounds know, this
allows filtering based on grouped results:</p>

<pre><code>developers =  Developer.find(:all, :group =&gt; &quot;salary&quot;,
  :having =&gt; &quot;sum(salary) &gt;  10000&quot;, :select =&gt; &quot;salary&quot;)
</code></pre>
<ul><li>
<p>Lead Contributor: <a href="http://github.com/miloops">Emilio Tagua</a></p>
</li></ul>

<h3 id="label-Reconnecting+MySQL+Connections">Reconnecting MySQL Connections</h3>

<p>MySQL supports a reconnect flag in its connections - if set to true, then
the client will try reconnecting to the server before giving up in case of
a lost connection. You can now set <code>reconnect = true</code> for your
MySQL connections in <code>database.yml</code> to get this behavior from a
<a href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> application. The default
is <code>false</code>, so the behavior of existing applications doesn&#39;t
change.</p>

</li></ul>

<h3 id="label-Other+Active+Record+Changes">Other Active Record Changes</h3>
<ul><li>
<p>An extra <code>AS</code> was removed from the generated SQL for
<code>has_and_belongs_to_many</code> preloading, making it work better for
some databases.</p>
</li><li>
<p><code>ActiveRecord::Base#new_record?</code> now returns <code>false</code>
rather than <code>nil</code> when confronted with an existing record.</p>
</li><li>
<p><a href="../../../../classes/A.html">A</a> bug in quoting table names in
some <code>has_many :through</code> associations was fixed.</p>
</li><li>
<p>You can now specify a particular timestamp for <code>updated_at</code>
timestamps: <code>cust = Customer.create(:name =&gt; &quot;ABC
Industries&quot;, :updated_at =&gt; 1.day.ago)</code></p>
</li><li>
<p>Better error messages on failed <code>find_by_attribute!</code> calls.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Active Record&#39;s <code>to_xml</code> support gets just a little bit more
flexible with the addition of a <code>:camelize</code> option.</p>
</li><li>
<p><a href="../../../../classes/A.html">A</a> bug in canceling callbacks from
<code>before_update</code> or <code>before_create</code> was fixed.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Rake tasks for testing databases via JDBC have been added.</p>
</li><li>
<p><code>validates_length_of</code> will use a custom error message with the
<code>:in</code> or <code>:within</code> options (if one is supplied).</p>
</li><li>
<p>Counts on scoped selects now work properly, so you can do things like
<code>Account.scoped(:select =&gt; &quot;DISTINCT
credit_limit&quot;).count</code>.</p>
</li><li>
<p><code>ActiveRecord::Base#invalid?</code> now works as the opposite of
<code>ActiveRecord::Base#valid?</code>.</p>
</li></ul>

<h2 id="label-Action+Controller">Action Controller</h2>

<p>Action Controller rolls out some significant changes to rendering, as well
as improvements in routing and other areas, in this release.</p>

<h3 id="label-Unified+Rendering">Unified Rendering</h3>

<p><code>ActionController::Base#render</code> is a lot smarter about deciding
what to render. Now you can just tell it what to render and expect to get
the right results. In older versions of <a
href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a>, you often need to supply
explicit information to render:</p>

<pre><code>render :file =&gt; &#39;/tmp/random_file.erb&#39;
render :template =&gt; &#39;other_controller/action&#39;
render :action =&gt; &#39;show&#39;
</code></pre>

<p>Now in <a href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> 2.3, you can just
supply what you want to render:</p>

<pre><code>render &#39;/tmp/random_file.erb&#39;
render &#39;other_controller/action&#39;
render &#39;show&#39;
render :show
</code></pre>

<p><a href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> chooses between file,
template, and action depending on whether there is a leading slash, an
embedded slash, or no slash at all in what&#39;s to be rendered. Note that
you can also use a symbol instead of a string when rendering an action.
Other rendering styles (<code>:inline</code>, <code>:text</code>,
<code>:update</code>, <code>:nothing</code>, <code>:json</code>,
<code>:xml</code>, <code>:js</code>) still require an explicit option.</p>

<h3 id="label-Application+Controller+Renamed">Application Controller Renamed</h3>

<p>If you&#39;re one of the people who has always been bothered by the
special-case naming of <code>application.rb</code>, rejoice! It&#39;s been
reworked to be application_controller.rb in <a
href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> 2.3. In addition,
there&#39;s a new rake task, <code>rake
rails:update:application_controller</code> to do this automatically for you
- and it will be run as part of the normal <code>rake rails:update</code>
process.</p>

</li></ul>
</li></ul>

<h3 id="label-HTTP+Digest+Authentication+Support">HTTP Digest Authentication Support</h3>

<p><a href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> now has built-in support
for HTTP digest authentication. To use it, you call
<code>authenticate_or_request_with_http_digest</code> with a block that
returns the user’s password (which is then hashed and compared against the
transmitted credentials):</p>

<pre><code>class PostsController &lt; ApplicationController
  Users = {&quot;dhh&quot; =&gt; &quot;secret&quot;}
  before_filter :authenticate

  def secret
    render :text =&gt; &quot;Password Required!&quot;
  end

  private
  def authenticate
    realm = &quot;Application&quot;
    authenticate_or_request_with_http_digest(realm) do |name|
      Users[name]
    end

</li></ul>

<h3 id="label-More+Efficient+Routing">More Efficient Routing</h3>

<p>There are a couple of significant routing changes in <a
href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> 2.3. The
<code>formatted_</code> route helpers are gone, in favor just passing in
<code>:format</code> as an option. This cuts down the route generation
process by 50% for any resource - and can save a substantial amount of
memory (up to 100MB on large applications). If your code uses the
<code>formatted_</code> helpers, it will still work for the time being -
but that behavior is deprecated and your application will be more efficient
if you rewrite those routes using the new standard. <a
href="../../../../classes/Another.html">Another</a> big change is that <a
href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> now supports multiple
routing files, not just <code>routes.rb</code>. You can use
<code>RouteSet#add_configuration_file</code> to bring in more routes at any
time - without clearing the currently-loaded routes. While this change is
most useful for Engines, you can use it in any application that needs to
load routes in batches.</p>

<h3 id="label-Rack-based+Lazy-loaded+Sessions">Rack-based Lazy-loaded Sessions</h3>

<p><a href="../../../../classes/A.html">A</a> big change pushed the
underpinnings of Action Controller session storage down to the <a
href="../../../../classes/Rack.html">Rack</a> level. This involved a good
deal of work in the code, though it should be completely transparent to
your <a href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> applications (as a
bonus, some icky patches around the old CGI session handler got removed).
It&#39;s still significant, though, for one simple reason: non-Rails <a
href="../../../../classes/Rack.html">Rack</a> applications have access to
the same session storage handlers (and therefore the same session) as your
<a href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> applications. In
addition, sessions are now lazy-loaded (in line with the loading
improvements to the rest of the framework). This means that you no longer
need to explicitly disable sessions if you don&#39;t want them; just
don&#39;t refer to them and they won&#39;t load.</p>

<h3 id="label-MIME+Type+Handling+Changes">MIME Type Handling Changes</h3>

<p>There are a couple of changes to the code for handling MIME types in <a
href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a>. First,
<code>MIME::Type</code> now implements the <code>=~</code> operator, making
things much cleaner when you need to check for the presence of a type that
has synonyms:</p>

<pre><code>if content_type &amp;&amp; Mime::JS =~ content_type
  # do something cool
end

Mime::JS =~ &quot;text/javascript&quot;        =&gt; true
Mime::JS =~ &quot;application/javascript&quot; =&gt; true
</code></pre>

<p>The other change is that the framework now uses the <code>Mime::JS</code>
when checking for JavaScript in various spots, making it handle those
alternatives cleanly.</p>

<h3 id="label-Optimization+of+respond_to">Optimization of <code>respond_to</code></h3>

<p>In some of the first fruits of the Rails-Merb team merger, <a
href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> 2.3 includes some
optimizations for the <code>respond_to</code> method, which is of course
heavily used in many <a href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a>
applications to allow your controller to format results differently based
on the MIME type of the incoming request. After eliminating a call to
<code>method_missing</code> and some profiling and tweaking, we&#39;re
seeing an 8% improvement in the number of requests per second served with a
simple <code>respond_to</code> that switches between three formats. The
best part? No change at all required to the code of your application to
take advantage of this speedup.</p>

<h3 id="label-Improved+Caching+Performance">Improved Caching Performance</h3>

<p><a href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> now keeps a per-request
local cache of read from the remote cache stores, cutting down on
unnecessary reads and leading to better site performance. While this work
was originally limited to <code>MemCacheStore</code>, it is available to
any remote store than implements the required methods.</p>

</li></ul>

<h3 id="label-Localized+Views">Localized Views</h3>

<p><a href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> can now provide
localized views, depending on the locale that you have set. For example,
suppose you have a <code>Posts</code> controller with a <code>show</code>
action. By default, this will render
<code>app/views/posts/show.html.erb</code>. But if you set
<code>I18n.locale = :da</code>, it will render
<code>app/views/posts/show.da.html.erb</code>. If the localized template
isn&#39;t present, the undecorated version will be used. <a
href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> also includes
<code>I18n#available_locales</code> and
<code>I18n::SimpleBackend#available_locales</code>, which return an array
of the translations that are available in the current <a
href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> project.</p>

<p>In addition, you can use the same scheme to localize the rescue files in
the <code>public</code> directory: <code>public/500.da.html</code> or
<code>public/404.en.html</code> work, for example.</p>

<h3 id="label-Partial+Scoping+for+Translations">Partial Scoping for Translations</h3>

<p><a href="../../../../classes/A.html">A</a> change to the translation API
makes things easier and less repetitive to write key translations within
partials. If you call <code>translate(&quot;.foo&quot;)</code> from the
<code>people/index.html.erb</code> template, you&#39;ll actually be calling
<code>I18n.translate(&quot;people.index.foo&quot;)</code> If you don&#39;t
prepend the key with a period, then the API doesn&#39;t scope, just as
before.</p>

<h3 id="label-Other+Action+Controller+Changes">Other Action Controller Changes</h3>
<ul><li>
<p>ETag handling has been cleaned up a bit: <a
href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> will now skip sending an
ETag header when there&#39;s no body to the response or when sending files
with <code>send_file</code>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>The fact that <a href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> checks for
IP spoofing can be a nuisance for sites that do heavy traffic with cell
phones, because their proxies don&#39;t generally set things up right. If
that&#39;s you, you can now set
<code>ActionController::Base.ip_spoofing_check = false</code> to disable
the check entirely.</p>
</li><li>
<p><code>ActionController::Dispatcher</code> now implements its own middleware
stack, which you can see by running <code>rake middleware</code>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Cookie sessions now have persistent session identifiers, with API
compatibility with the server-side stores.</p>
</li><li>
<p>You can now use symbols for the <code>:type</code> option of
<code>send_file</code> and <code>send_data</code>, like this:
<code>send_file(&quot;fabulous.png&quot;, :type =&gt; :png)</code>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>The <code>:only</code> and <code>:except</code> options for
<code>map.resources</code> are no longer inherited by nested resources.</p>
</li><li>
<p>The bundled memcached client has been updated to version 1.6.4.99.</p>
</li><li>
<p>The <code>expires_in</code>, <code>stale?</code>, and
<code>fresh_when</code> methods now accept a <code>:public</code> option to
make them work well with proxy caching.</p>
</li><li>
<p>The <code>:requirements</code> option now works properly with additional
RESTful member routes.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Shallow routes now properly respect namespaces.</p>
</li><li>
<p><code>polymorphic_url</code> does a better job of handling objects with
irregular plural names.</p>
</li></ul>

<h2 id="label-Action+View">Action View</h2>

<p>Action View in <a href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> 2.3 picks
up nested model forms, improvements to <code>render</code>, more flexible
prompts for the date select helpers, and a speedup in asset caching, among
other things.</p>

<h3 id="label-Nested+Object+Forms"><a href="../../../../classes/Nested.html">Nested</a> <a href="../../../../classes/Object.html">Object</a> Forms</h3>

<p>Provided the parent model accepts nested attributes for the child objects
(as discussed in the Active Record section), you can create nested forms
using <code>form_for</code> and <code>field_for</code>. These forms can be
nested arbitrarily deep, allowing you to edit complex object hierarchies on
a single view without excessive code. For example, given this model:</p>

<pre><code>class Customer &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :orders

  accepts_nested_attributes_for :orders, :allow_destroy =&gt; true
end
</code></pre>

<p>You can write this view in <a
href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> 2.3:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;% form_for @customer do |customer_form| %&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;%= customer_form.label :name, &#39;Customer Name:&#39; %&gt;
    &lt;%= customer_form.text_field :name %&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;!-- Here we call fields_for on the customer_form builder instance.
   The block is called for each member of the orders collection. --&gt;
  &lt;% customer_form.fields_for :orders do |order_form| %&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;%= order_form.label :number, &#39;Order Number:&#39; %&gt;
        &lt;%= order_form.text_field :number %&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;!-- The allow_destroy option in the model enables deletion of
   child records. --&gt;
      &lt;% unless order_form.object.new_record? %&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;
          &lt;%= order_form.label :_delete, &#39;Remove:&#39; %&gt;
          &lt;%= order_form.check_box :_delete %&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;% end %&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;% end %&gt;

  &lt;%= customer_form.submit %&gt;

<h3 id="label-Smart+Rendering+of+Partials">Smart Rendering of Partials</h3>

<p>The render method has been getting smarter over the years, and it&#39;s
even smarter now. If you have an object or a collection and an appropriate
partial, and the naming matches up, you can now just render the object and
things will work. For example, in <a
href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> 2.3, these render calls
will work in your view (assuming sensible naming):</p>

<pre><code># Equivalent of render :partial =&gt; &#39;articles/_article&#39;,
# :object =&gt; @article
render @article

# Equivalent of render :partial =&gt; &#39;articles/_article&#39;,
# :collection =&gt; @articles

<h3 id="label-Prompts+for+Date+Select+Helpers">Prompts for <a href="../../../../classes/Date.html">Date</a> <a href="../../../../classes/Select.html">Select</a> Helpers</h3>

<p>In <a href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> 2.3, you can supply
custom prompts for the various date select helpers
(<code>date_select</code>, <code>time_select</code>, and
<code>datetime_select</code>), the same way you can with collection select
helpers. You can supply a prompt string or a hash of individual prompt
strings for the various components. You can also just set
<code>:prompt</code> to <code>true</code> to use the custom generic prompt:</p>

<pre><code>select_datetime(DateTime.now, :prompt =&gt; true)

select_datetime(DateTime.now, :prompt =&gt; &quot;Choose date and time&quot;)

select_datetime(DateTime.now, :prompt =&gt;
  {:day =&gt; &#39;Choose day&#39;, :month =&gt; &#39;Choose month&#39;,
   :year =&gt; &#39;Choose year&#39;, :hour =&gt; &#39;Choose hour&#39;,
   :minute =&gt; &#39;Choose minute&#39;})

<h3 id="label-AssetTag+Timestamp+Caching">AssetTag Timestamp Caching</h3>

<p>You&#39;re likely familiar with Rails&#39; practice of adding timestamps to
static asset paths as a “cache buster.” This helps ensure that stale copies
of things like images and stylesheets don&#39;t get served out of the
user&#39;s browser cache when you change them on the server. You can now
modify this behavior with the <code>cache_asset_timestamps</code>
configuration option for Action View. If you enable the cache, then <a
href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> will calculate the
timestamp once when it first serves an asset, and save that value. This
means fewer (expensive) file system calls to serve static assets - but it
also means that you can&#39;t modify any of the assets while the server is
running and expect the changes to get picked up by clients.</p>

<h3 id="label-Asset+Hosts+as+Objects">Asset Hosts as Objects</h3>

<p>Asset hosts get more flexible in edge <a
href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> with the ability to declare
an asset host as a specific object that responds to a call. This allows you
to implement any complex logic you need in your asset hosting.</p>
<ul><li>
<p>More Information: <a
href="http://github.com/dhh/asset-hosting-with-minimum-ssl/tree/master">asset-hosting-with-minimum-ssl</a></p>
</li></ul>

<h3 id="label-grouped_options_for_select+Helper+Method">grouped_options_for_select Helper Method</h3>

<p>Action View already had a bunch of helpers to aid in generating select
controls, but now there&#39;s one more:
<code>grouped_options_for_select</code>. This one accepts an array or hash
of strings, and converts them into a string of <code>option</code> tags
wrapped with <code>optgroup</code> tags. For example:</p>

<pre><code>grouped_options_for_select([[&quot;Hats&quot;, [&quot;Baseball Cap&quot;,&quot;Cowboy Hat&quot;]]],
  &quot;Cowboy Hat&quot;, &quot;Choose a product...&quot;)
</code></pre>

<p>returns</p>

<pre><code>&lt;option value=&quot;&quot;&gt;Choose a product...&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;optgroup label=&quot;Hats&quot;&gt;
  &lt;option value=&quot;Baseball Cap&quot;&gt;Baseball Cap&lt;/option&gt;
  &lt;option selected=&quot;selected&quot; value=&quot;Cowboy Hat&quot;&gt;Cowboy Hat&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;/optgroup&gt;
</code></pre>

<h3 id="label-Disabled+Option+Tags+for+Form+Select+Helpers">Disabled Option Tags for Form <a href="../../../../classes/Select.html">Select</a> Helpers</h3>

<p>The form select helpers (such as <code>select</code> and
<code>options_for_select</code>) now support a <code>:disabled</code>
option, which can take a single value or an array of values to be disabled
in the resulting tags:</p>

<pre><code>select(:post, :category, Post::CATEGORIES, :disabled =&gt; &#39;private&#39;)
</code></pre>

<p>returns</p>

<pre><code>&lt;select name=“post[category]“&gt;
&lt;option&gt;story&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;option&gt;joke&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;option&gt;poem&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;option disabled=“disabled“&gt;private&lt;/option&gt;
&lt;/select&gt;</code></pre>

<p>You can also use an anonymous function to determine at runtime which
options from collections will be selected and/or disabled:</p>

<pre><code>options_from_collection_for_select(@product.sizes, :name, :id, :disabled =&gt; lambda{|size| size.out_of_stock?})
</code></pre>

<h3 id="label-A+Note+About+Template+Loading"><a href="../../../../classes/A.html">A</a> Note About Template Loading</h3>

<p><a href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> 2.3 includes the ability
to enable or disable cached templates for any particular environment.
Cached templates give you a speed boost because they don&#39;t check for a
new template file when they&#39;re rendered - but they also mean that you
can&#39;t replace a template “on the fly” without restarting the server.</p>

<p>In most cases, you&#39;ll want template caching to be turned on in
production, which you can do by making a setting in your
<code>production.rb</code> file:</p>

<pre><code>config.action_view.cache_template_loading = true
</code></pre>

<p>This line will be generated for you by default in a new <a
href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> 2.3 application. If
you&#39;ve upgraded from an older version of <a
href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a>, <a
href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> will default to caching
templates in production and test but not in development.</p>

<h3 id="label-Other+Action+View+Changes">Other Action View Changes</h3>
<ul><li>
<p>Token generation for CSRF protection has been simplified; now <a
href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> uses a simple random string
generated by <code>ActiveSupport::SecureRandom</code> rather than mucking
around with session IDs.</p>
</li><li>
<p><code>auto_link</code> now properly applies options (such as
<code>:target</code> and <code>:class</code>) to generated e-mail links.</p>
</li><li>
<p>The <code>autolink</code> helper has been refactored to make it a bit less
messy and more intuitive.</p>
</li><li>
<p><code>current_page?</code> now works properly even when there are multiple
query parameters in the URL.</p>
</li></ul>

<h2 id="label-Active+Support">Active Support</h2>

<p>Active Support has a few interesting changes, including the introduction of
<code>Object#try</code>.</p>

<h3 id="label-Object%23try"><a href="../../../../classes/Object.html#method-i-try">Object#try</a></h3>

<p><a href="../../../../classes/A.html">A</a> lot of folks have adopted the
notion of using try() to attempt operations on objects. It&#39;s especially
helpful in views where you can avoid nil-checking by writing code like
<code>&lt;%= @person.try(:name) %&gt;</code>. Well, now it&#39;s baked
right into <a href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a>. As
implemented in <a href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a>, it
raises <code>NoMethodError</code> on private methods and always returns
<code>nil</code> if the object is nil.</p>

</li></ul>

<h3 id="label-Object%23tap+Backport">Object#tap Backport</h3>

<p><code>Object#tap</code> is an addition to <a
href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9/classes/Object.html#M000309">Ruby
1.9</a> and 1.8.7 that is similar to the <code>returning</code> method that
<a href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> has had for a while: it
yields to a block, and then returns the object that was yielded. <a
href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> now includes code to make
this available under older versions of Ruby as well.</p>

<h3 id="label-Swappable+Parsers+for+XMLmini">Swappable Parsers for XMLmini</h3>

<p>The support for XML parsing in <a
href="../../../../classes/ActiveSupport.html">ActiveSupport</a> has been

default, it uses the standard REXML implementation, but you can easily
specify the faster <a href="../../../../classes/LibXML.html">LibXML</a> or

number of digits in the fractional second part of the returned string that
<code>Time</code> does:</p>

generator. What this means is that we now have template-based application
generation built right into <a
href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a>; if you have a set of
plugins you include in every application (among many other use cases), you
can just set up a template once and use it over and over again when you run
the <code>rails</code> command. There&#39;s also a rake task to apply a
template to an existing application:</p>

<pre><code>rake rails:template LOCATION=~/template.rb</code></pre>

<p>This will layer the changes from the template on top of whatever code the
project already contains.</p>

<h3 id="label-Quieter+Backtraces">Quieter Backtraces</h3>

<p>Building on Thoughtbot&#39;s <a
href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/quietbacktrace">Quiet Backtrace</a>
plugin, which allows you to selectively remove lines from
<code>Test::Unit</code> backtraces, <a
href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> 2.3 implements
<code>ActiveSupport::BacktraceCleaner</code> and
<code>Rails::BacktraceCleaner</code> in core. This supports both filters
(to perform regex-based substitutions on backtrace lines) and silencers (to
remove backtrace lines entirely). <a
href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> automatically adds
silencers to get rid of the most common noise in a new application, and
builds a <code>config/backtrace_silencers.rb</code> file to hold your own
additions. This feature also enables prettier printing from any gem in the
backtrace.</p>

<h3 id="label-Faster+Boot+Time+in+Development+Mode+with+Lazy+Loading%2FAutoload">Faster Boot <a href="../../../../classes/Time.html">Time</a> in Development Mode with Lazy Loading/Autoload</h3>

<p>Quite a bit of work was done to make sure that bits of <a
href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> (and its dependencies) are
only brought into memory when they&#39;re actually needed. The core
frameworks - Active Support, Active Record, Action Controller, Action
Mailer and Action View - are now using <code>autoload</code> to lazy-load
their individual classes. This work should help keep the memory footprint
down and improve overall <a href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a>
performance.</p>

<p>You can also specify (by using the new <code>preload_frameworks</code>
option) whether the core libraries should be autoloaded at startup. This
defaults to <code>false</code> so that <a
href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> autoloads itself
piece-by-piece, but there are some circumstances where you still need to
bring in everything at once - Passenger and JRuby both want to see all of
<a href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> loaded together.</p>

<h3 id="label-rake+gem+Task+Rewrite">rake gem <a href="../../../../classes/Task.html">Task</a> Rewrite</h3>

<p>The internals of the various <code>rake gem</code> tasks have been
substantially revised, to make the system work better for a variety of
cases. The gem system now knows the difference between development and
runtime dependencies, has a more robust unpacking system, gives better
information when querying for the status of gems, and is less prone to
“chicken and egg” dependency issues when you&#39;re bringing things up from
scratch. There are also fixes for using gem commands under JRuby and for
dependencies that try to bring in external copies of gems that are already
vendored.</p>

<h3 id="label-Other+Railties+Changes">Other Railties Changes</h3>
<ul><li>
<p>The instructions for updating a CI server to build <a
href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> have been updated and
expanded.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Internal <a href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> testing has
been switched from <code>Test::Unit::TestCase</code> to
<code>ActiveSupport::TestCase</code>, and the <a
href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> core requires Mocha to
test.</p>
</li><li>
<p>The default <code>environment.rb</code> file has been decluttered.</p>
</li><li>
<p>The dbconsole script now lets you use an all-numeric password without
crashing.</p>
</li><li>
<p><code>Rails.root</code> now returns a <code>Pathname</code> object, which
means you can use it directly with the <code>join</code> method to <a
href="http://afreshcup.com/2008/12/05/a-little-rails_root-tidiness/">clean
up existing code</a> that uses <code>File.join</code>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Various files in /public that deal with CGI and FCGI dispatching are no
longer generated in every <a
href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> application by default (you
can still get them if you need them by adding
<code>--with-dispatchers</code> when you run the <code>rails</code>
command, or add them later with <code>rake
rails:update:generate_dispatchers</code>).</p>
</li><li>
<p><a href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> Guides have been
converted from AsciiDoc to Textile markup.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Scaffolded views and controllers have been cleaned up a bit.</p>
</li><li>
<p><code>script/server</code> now accepts a <code>--path</code> argument to
mount a <a href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> application from
a specific path.</p>
</li><li>
<p>If any configured gems are missing, the gem rake tasks will skip loading
much of the environment. This should solve many of the “chicken-and-egg”
problems where rake gems:install couldn&#39;t run because gems were
missing.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Gems are now unpacked exactly once. This fixes issues with gems (hoe, for
instance) which are packed with read-only permissions on the files.</p>
</li></ul>

<h2 id="label-Deprecated">Deprecated</h2>

<p><a href="../../../../classes/A.html">A</a> few pieces of older code are
deprecated in this release:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>If you&#39;re one of the (fairly rare) <a
href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> developers who deploys in a
fashion that depends on the inspector, reaper, and spawner scripts,
you&#39;ll need to know that those scripts are no longer included in core
<a href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a>. If you need them,
you&#39;ll be able to pick up copies via the <a
href="http://github.com/rails/irs_process_scripts/tree">irs_process_scripts</a>
plugin.</p>
</li><li>
<p><code>render_component</code> goes from “deprecated” to “nonexistent” in <a
href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> 2.3. If you still need it,
you can install the <a
href="http://github.com/rails/render_component/tree/master.">render_component
plugin</a></p>
</li><li>
<p>Support for <a href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> components
has been removed.</p>
</li><li>
<p>If you were one of the people who got used to running
<code>script/performance/request</code> to look at performance based on
integration tests, you need to learn a new trick: that script has been
removed from core <a href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> now.
There’s a new request_profiler plugin that you can install to get the exact
same functionality back.</p>
</li><li>
<p><code>ActionController::Base#session_enabled?</code> is deprecated because
sessions are lazy-loaded now.</p>
</li><li>
<p>The <code>:digest</code> and <code>:secret</code> options to
<code>protect_from_forgery</code> are deprecated and have no effect.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Some integration test helpers have been removed.
<code>response.headers["Status"]</code> and <code>headers["Status"]</code>
will no longer return anything. <a
href="../../../../classes/Rack.html">Rack</a> does not allow “Status” in
its return headers. However you can still use the <code>status</code> and
<code>status_message</code> helpers.
<code>response.headers["cookie"]</code> and <code>headers["cookie"]</code>
will no longer return any CGI cookies. You can inspect
<code>headers["Set-Cookie"]</code> to see the raw cookie header or use the
<code>cookies</code> helper to get a hash of the cookies sent to the
client.</p>
</li><li>
<p><code>formatted_polymorphic_url</code> is deprecated. Use
<code>polymorphic_url</code> with <code>:format</code> instead.</p>
</li><li>
<p>The <code>:http_only</code> option in
<code>ActionController::Response#set_cookie</code> has been renamed to
<code>:httponly</code>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>The <code>:connector</code> and <code>:skip_last_comma</code> options of
<code>to_sentence</code> have been replaced by
<code>:words_connnector</code>, <code>:two_words_connector</code>, and
<code>:last_word_connector</code> options.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Posting a multipart form with an empty <code>file_field</code> control used
to submit an empty string to the controller. Now it submits a nil, due to
differences between Rack&#39;s multipart parser and the old <a
href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> one.</p>
</li></ul>
