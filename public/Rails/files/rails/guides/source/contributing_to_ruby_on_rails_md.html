<p>This guide covers ways in which <em>you</em> can become a part of the
ongoing development of Ruby on <a
href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a>.</p>

<p>After reading this guide, you will know:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>How to use GitHub to report issues.</p>
</li><li>
<p>How to clone master and run the test suite.</p>
</li><li>
<p>How to help resolve existing issues.</p>
</li><li>
<p>How to contribute to the Ruby on <a
href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> documentation.</p>
</li><li>
<p>How to contribute to the Ruby on <a
href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> code.</p>
</li></ul>

<p>Ruby on <a href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> is not “someone
else&#39;s framework.” Over the years, hundreds of people have contributed
to Ruby on <a href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> ranging from
a single character to massive architectural changes or significant
documentation — all with the goal of making Ruby on <a
href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> better for everyone. Even
if you don&#39;t feel up to writing code or documentation yet, there are a
variety of other ways that you can contribute, from reporting issues to
testing patches.</p>
<hr style="height: 1px">

<h2 id="label-Reporting+an+Issue">Reporting an Issue</h2>

<p>Ruby on <a href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> uses <a
href="https://github.com/rails/rails/issues">GitHub Issue Tracking</a> to
track issues (primarily bugs and contributions of new code). If you&#39;ve
found a bug in Ruby on <a href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a>,
this is the place to start. You&#39;ll need to create a (free) GitHub
account in order to submit an issue, to comment on them or to create pull
requests.</p>

<p>NOTE: Bugs in the most recent released version of Ruby on <a
href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> are likely to get the most
attention. Also, the <a href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a>
core team is always interested in feedback from those who can take the time
to test <em>edge <a href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a></em>
(the code for the version of <a
href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> that is currently under
development). Later in this guide you&#39;ll find out how to get edge <a
href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> for testing.</p>

<h3 id="label-Creating+a+Bug+Report">Creating a Bug Report</h3>

<p>If you&#39;ve found a problem in Ruby on <a
href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> which is not a security
risk, do a search in GitHub under <a
href="https://github.com/rails/rails/issues">Issues</a> in case it was
already reported. If you find no issue addressing it you can <a
href="https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/new">add a new one</a>. (See
the next section for reporting security issues).</p>

<p>At the minimum, your issue report needs a title and descriptive text. But
that&#39;s only a minimum. You should include as much relevant information
as possible. You need at least to post the code sample that has the issue.
Even better is to include a unit test that shows how the expected behavior
is not occurring. Your goal should be to make it easy for yourself — and
others — to replicate the bug and figure out a fix.</p>

<p>Then, don&#39;t get your hopes up! Unless you have a “Code Red, Mission
Critical, the World is Coming to an End” kind of bug, you&#39;re creating
this issue report in the hope that others with the same problem will be
able to collaborate with you on solving it. Do not expect that the issue
report will automatically see any activity or that others will jump to fix
it. Creating an issue like this is mostly to help yourself start on the
path of fixing the problem and for others to confirm it with an “I&#39;m
having this problem too” comment.</p>

<h3 id="label-Special+Treatment+for+Security+Issues">Special Treatment for Security Issues</h3>

<p>WARNING: Please do not report security vulnerabilities with public GitHub
issue reports. The <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/security">Rails security
policy page</a> details the procedure to follow for security issues.</p>

<h3 id="label-What+about+Feature+Requests%3F">What about Feature Requests?</h3>

<p>Please don&#39;t put “feature request” items into GitHub Issues. If
there&#39;s a new feature that you want to see added to Ruby on <a
href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a>, you&#39;ll need to write
the code yourself - or convince someone else to partner with you to write
the code. Later in this guide you&#39;ll find detailed instructions for
proposing a patch to Ruby on <a
href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a>. If you enter a wishlist
item in GitHub Issues with no code, you can expect it to be marked
“invalid” as soon as it&#39;s reviewed.</p>

<p>If you&#39;d like feedback on an idea for a feature before doing the work
for make a patch, please send an email to the <a
href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/rubyonrails-core">rails-core
mailing list</a>. You might get no response, which means that everyone is
indifferent. You might find someone who&#39;s also interested in building
that feature. You might get a “This won&#39;t be accepted.” But it&#39;s
the proper place to discuss new ideas. GitHub Issues are not a particularly
good venue for the sometimes long and involved discussions new features
require.</p>

<h2 id="label-Setting+Up+a+Development+Environment">Setting Up a Development Environment</h2>

<p>To move on from submitting bugs to helping resolve existing issues or
contributing your own code to Ruby on <a
href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a>, you <em>must</em> be able
to run its test suite. In this section of the guide you&#39;ll learn how to
set up the tests on your own computer.</p>

<h3 id="label-The+Easy+Way">The Easy Way</h3>

<p>The easiest and recommended way to get a development environment ready to
hack is to use the <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails-dev-box">Rails
development box</a>.</p>

<h3 id="label-The+Hard+Way">The Hard Way</h3>

<p>In case you can&#39;t use the <a
href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> development box, see
section above, check <a
href="http://development_dependencies_install.html">this other guide</a>.</p>

<h2 id="label-Testing+Active+Record">Testing Active Record</h2>

<p>This is how you run the Active Record test suite only for SQLite3:</p>

<pre><code>$ cd activerecord
$ bundle exec rake test_sqlite3</code></pre>

<p>You can now run the tests as you did for <code>sqlite3</code>. The tasks
are respectively</p>

<pre><code>test_mysql
test_mysql2
test_postgresql</code></pre>

<p>Finally,</p>

<pre><code>$ bundle exec rake test</code></pre>

<p>will now run the four of them in turn.</p>

<p>You can also run any single test separately:</p>

<pre><code>$ ARCONN=sqlite3 ruby -Itest test/cases/associations/has_many_associations_test.rb</code></pre>

<p>You can invoke <code>test_jdbcmysql</code>, <code>test_jdbcsqlite3</code>
or <code>test_jdbcpostgresql</code> also. See the file
<code>activerecord/RUNNING_UNIT_TESTS.rdoc</code> for information on
running more targeted database tests, or the file <code>ci/travis.rb</code>
for the test suite run by the continuous integration server.</p>

<h3 id="label-Warnings">Warnings</h3>

<p>The test suite runs with warnings enabled. Ideally, Ruby on <a
href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> should issue no warnings,
but there may be a few, as well as some from third-party libraries. Please
ignore (or fix!) them, if any, and submit patches that do not issue new
warnings.</p>

<p>As of this writing (December, 2010) they are especially noisy with Ruby
1.9. If you are sure about what you are doing and would like to have a more
clear output, there&#39;s a way to override the flag:</p>

<pre><code>$ RUBYOPT=-W0 bundle exec rake test</code></pre>

<h3 id="label-Older+Versions+of+Ruby+on+Rails">Older Versions of Ruby on <a href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a></h3>

<p>If you want to add a fix to older versions of Ruby on <a
href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a>, you&#39;ll need to set up
and switch to your own local tracking branch. Here is an example to switch
to the 3-0-stable branch:</p>

<pre><code>$ git branch --track 3-0-stable origin/3-0-stable
$ git checkout 3-0-stable</code></pre>

<p>TIP: You may want to <a
href="http://qugstart.com/blog/git-and-svn/add-colored-git-branch-name-to-your-shell-prompt/">put
your Git branch name in your shell prompt</a> to make it easier to remember
which version of the code you&#39;re working with.</p>

<h2 id="label-Helping+to+Resolve+Existing+Issues">Helping to Resolve Existing Issues</h2>

<p>As a next step beyond reporting issues, you can help the core team resolve
existing issues. If you check the <a
href="https://github.com/rails/rails/issues">Everyone’s Issues</a> list in
GitHub Issues, you&#39;ll find lots of issues already requiring attention.
What can you do for these? Quite a bit, actually:</p>

<h3 id="label-Verifying+Bug+Reports">Verifying Bug Reports</h3>

<p>For starters, it helps just to verify bug reports. Can you reproduce the
reported issue on your own computer? If so, you can add a comment to the
issue saying that you&#39;re seeing the same thing.</p>

<p>If something is very vague, can you help squash it down into something
specific? Maybe you can provide additional information to help reproduce a
bug, or help by eliminating needless steps that aren&#39;t required to
demonstrate the problem.</p>

<p>If you find a bug report without a test, it&#39;s very useful to contribute
a failing test. This is also a great way to get started exploring the
source code: looking at the existing test files will teach you how to write
more tests. New tests are best contributed in the form of a patch, as
explained later on in the “Contributing to the <a
href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> Code” section.</p>

<p>Anything you can do to make bug reports more succinct or easier to
reproduce is a help to folks trying to write code to fix those bugs -
whether you end up writing the code yourself or not.</p>

<h3 id="label-Testing+Patches">Testing Patches</h3>

<p>You can also help out by examining pull requests that have been submitted
to Ruby on <a href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> via GitHub.
To apply someone&#39;s changes you need first to create a dedicated branch:</p>

<pre><code>$ git checkout -b testing_branch</code></pre>

<p>Then you can use their remote branch to update your codebase. For example,
let&#39;s say the GitHub user JohnSmith has forked and pushed to a topic
branch “orange” located at <a
href="https://github.com/JohnSmith/rails">github.com/JohnSmith/rails</a>.</p>

<pre><code>$ git remote add JohnSmith git://github.com/JohnSmith/rails.git
$ git pull JohnSmith orange</code></pre>

<p>After applying their branch, test it out! Here are some things to think
about:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Does the change actually work?</p>
</li><li>
<p>Are you happy with the tests? Can you follow what they&#39;re testing? Are
there any tests missing?</p>
</li><li>
<p>Does it have the proper documentation coverage? Should documentation
elsewhere be updated?</p>
</li><li>
<p>Do you like the implementation? Can you think of a nicer or faster way to
implement a part of their change?</p>
</li></ul>

<p>Once you&#39;re happy that the pull request contains a good change, comment
on the GitHub issue indicating your approval. Your comment should indicate
that you like the change and what you like about it. Something like:</p>
<blockquote>
I like the way you've restructured that code in generate_finder_sql — much nicer. The tests look good too.
</blockquote>
<p>If your comment simply says “+1”, then odds are that other reviewers
aren&#39;t going to take it too seriously. Show that you took the time to
review the pull request.</p>

<h2 id="label-Contributing+to+the+Rails+Documentation">Contributing to the <a href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> Documentation</h2>

<p>Ruby on <a href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> has two main
sets of documentation: the guides help you in learning about Ruby on <a
href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a>, and the API is a
reference.</p>

<p>You can help improve the <a href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a>
guides by making them more coherent, consistent or readable, adding missing
information, correcting factual errors, fixing typos, or bringing it up to
date with the latest edge <a
href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a>. To get involved in the
translation of <a href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> guides,
please see <a
href="https://wiki.github.com/lifo/docrails/translating-rails-guides">Translating
Rails Guides</a>.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re confident about your changes, you can push them directly
yourself via <a href="https://github.com/lifo/docrails">docrails</a>.
Docrails is a branch with an <strong>open commit policy</strong> and public
write access. Commits to docrails are still reviewed, but this happens
after they are pushed. Docrails is merged with master regularly, so you are
effectively editing the Ruby on <a
href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> documentation.</p>

<p>If you are unsure of the documentation changes, you can create an issue in
the <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/issues">Rails</a> issues
tracker on GitHub.</p>

<p>When working with documentation, please take into account the <a
href="http://api_documentation_guidelines.html">API Documentation
Guidelines</a> and the <a
href="http://ruby_on_rails_guides_guidelines.html">Ruby on Rails Guides
Guidelines</a>.</p>

<p>NOTE: As explained earlier, ordinary code patches should have proper
documentation coverage. Docrails is only used for isolated documentation
improvements.</p>

<p>NOTE: To help our CI servers you can add [ci skip] to your documentation
commit message to skip build on that commit. Please remember to use it for
commits containing only documentation changes.</p>

<p>WARNING: Docrails has a very strict policy: no code can be touched
whatsoever, no matter how trivial or small the change. Only RDoc and guides
can be edited via docrails. Also, CHANGELOGs should never be edited in
docrails.</p>

<h2 id="label-Contributing+to+the+Rails+Code">Contributing to the <a href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> Code</h2>

<h3 id="label-Clone+the+Rails+Repository">Clone the <a href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> Repository</h3>

<p>The first thing you need to do to be able to contribute code is to clone
the repository:</p>

<pre><code>$ git clone git://github.com/rails/rails.git</code></pre>

<p>and create a dedicated branch:</p>

<pre><code>$ cd rails
$ git checkout -b my_new_branch</code></pre>

<p>It doesn’t matter much what name you use, because this branch will only
exist on your local computer and your personal repository on Github. It
won&#39;t be part of the <a href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a>
Git repository.</p>

<h3 id="label-Write+Your+Code">Write Your Code</h3>

<p>Now get busy and add or edit code. You’re on your branch now, so you can
write whatever you want (you can check to make sure you’re on the right
branch with <code>git branch -a</code>). But if you’re planning to submit
your change back for inclusion in <a
href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a>, keep a few things in mind:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Get the code right.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Use <a href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> idioms and helpers.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Include tests that fail without your code, and pass with it.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Update the (surrounding) documentation, examples elsewhere, and the guides:
whatever is affected by your contribution.</p>
</li></ul>

<p>TIP: Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything
substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of <a
href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> will generally not be
accepted.</p>

<h3 id="label-Follow+the+Coding+Conventions">Follow the Coding Conventions</h3>

<p><a href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> follows a simple set of
coding style conventions:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Two spaces, no tabs (for indentation).</p>
</li><li>
<p>No trailing whitespace. Blank lines should not have any spaces.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Indent after private/protected.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Use Ruby &gt;= 1.9 syntax for hashes. Prefer <code>{ a: :b }</code> over
<code>{ :a =&gt; :b }</code>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Prefer <code>&amp;&amp;</code>/<code>||</code> over
<code>and</code>/<code>or</code>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Prefer class &lt;&lt; self over self.method for class methods.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Use <code>MyClass.my_method(my_arg)</code> not <code>my_method( my_arg
)</code> or <code>my_method my_arg</code>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Use <code>a = b</code> and not <code>a=b</code>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Use assert_not methods instead of refute.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Prefer <code>method { do_stuff }</code> instead of
<code>method{do_stuff}</code> for single-line blocks.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Follow the conventions in the source you see used already.</p>
</li></ul>

<p>The above are guidelines — please use your best judgment in using them.</p>

<h3 id="label-Updating+the+CHANGELOG">Updating the <a href="../../actionmailer/CHANGELOG_md.html">CHANGELOG</a></h3>

<p>The <a href="../../actionmailer/CHANGELOG_md.html">CHANGELOG</a> is an
important part of every release. It keeps the list of changes for every <a
href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> version.</p>

<p>You should add an entry to the <a
href="../../actionmailer/CHANGELOG_md.html">CHANGELOG</a> of the framework
that you modified if you&#39;re adding or removing a feature, commiting a
bug fix or adding deprecation notices. Refactorings and documentation
changes generally should not go to the <a
href="../../actionmailer/CHANGELOG_md.html">CHANGELOG</a>.</p>

<p><a href="../../../../classes/A.html">A</a> <a
href="../../actionmailer/CHANGELOG_md.html">CHANGELOG</a> entry should
summarize what was changed and should end with author&#39;s name. You can
use multiple lines if you need more space and you can attach code examples
indented with 4 spaces. If a change is related to a specific issue, you
should attach issue&#39;s number. Here is an example <a
href="../../actionmailer/CHANGELOG_md.html">CHANGELOG</a> entry:</p>

<pre><code>*   Summary of a change that briefly describes what was changed. You can use multiple
    lines and wrap them at around 80 characters. Code examples are ok, too, if needed:

        class Foo
          def bar
            puts &#39;baz&#39;
          end
        end

    You can continue after the code example and you can attach issue number. GH#1234

    *Your Name*
</code></pre>

<p>Your name can be added directly after the last word if you don&#39;t
provide any code examples or don&#39;t need multiple paragraphs. Otherwise,
it&#39;s best to make as a new paragraph.</p>

<h3 id="label-Sanity+Check">Sanity Check</h3>

<p>You should not be the only person who looks at the code before you submit
it. You know at least one other <a
href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> developer, right? Show them
what you’re doing and ask for feedback. Doing this in private before you
push a patch out publicly is the “smoke test” for a patch: if you can’t
convince one other developer of the beauty of your code, you’re unlikely to
convince the core team either.</p>

<p>You might want also to check out the <a
href="http://wiki.railsbridge.org/projects/railsbridge/wiki/BugMash">RailsBridge
BugMash</a> as a way to get involved in a group effort to improve <a
href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a>. This can help you get
started and help you check your code when you&#39;re writing your first
patches.</p>

<h3 id="label-Commit+Your+Changes">Commit Your Changes</h3>

<p>When you&#39;re happy with the code on your computer, you need to commit
the changes to Git:</p>

<pre><code>$ git commit -a</code></pre>

<p>At this point, your editor should be fired up and you can write a message
for this commit. Well formatted and descriptive commit messages are
extremely helpful for the others, especially when figuring out why given
change was made, so please take the time to write it.</p>

<p>Good commit message should be formatted according to the following example:</p>

<pre><code>Short summary (ideally 50 characters or less)

More detailed description, if necessary. It should be wrapped to 72
characters. Try to be as descriptive as you can, even if you think that
the commit content is obvious, it may not be obvious to others. You
should add such description also if it&#39;s already present in bug tracker,
it should not be necessary to visit a webpage to check the history.

Description can have multiple paragraphs and you can use code examples
inside, just indent it with 4 spaces:

    class PostsController
      def index
        respond_with Post.limit(10)
      end
    end

You can also add bullet points:

- you can use dashes or asterisks

- also, try to indent next line of a point for readability, if it&#39;s too
  long to fit in 72 characters
</code></pre>

<p>TIP. Please squash your commits into a single commit when appropriate. This
simplifies future cherry picks, and also keeps the git log clean.</p>

<h3 id="label-Update+Your+Branch">Update Your Branch</h3>

<p>It’s pretty likely that other changes to master have happened while you
were working. Go get them:</p>

<pre><code>$ git checkout master
$ git pull --rebase</code></pre>

<p>Now reapply your patch on top of the latest changes:</p>

<pre><code>$ git checkout my_new_branch
$ git rebase master</code></pre>

<p>No conflicts? Tests still pass? Change still seems reasonable to you? Then
move on.</p>

<h3 id="label-Fork">Fork</h3>

<p>Navigate to the <a href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> <a
href="https://github.com/rails/rails">GitHub repository</a> and press
“Fork” in the upper right hand corner.</p>

<p>Add the new remote to your local repository on your local machine:</p>

<pre><code>$ git remote add mine git@github.com:&lt;your user name&gt;/rails.git</code></pre>

<p>Push to your remote:</p>

<pre><code>$ git push mine my_new_branch</code></pre>

<p>You might have cloned your forked repository into your machine and might
want to add the original <a href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a>
repository as a remote instead, if that&#39;s the case here&#39;s what you
have to do.</p>

<p>In the directory you cloned your fork:</p>

<pre><code>$ git remote add rails git://github.com/rails/rails.git</code></pre>

<p>Download new commits and branches from the official repository:</p>

<pre><code>$ git fetch rails</code></pre>

<p>Merge the new content:</p>

<pre><code>$ git checkout master
$ git rebase rails/master</code></pre>

<p>Update your fork:</p>

<pre><code>$ git push origin master</code></pre>

<p>If you want to update another branch:</p>

<pre><code>$ git checkout branch_name
$ git rebase rails/branch_name
$ git push origin branch_name</code></pre>

<h3 id="label-Issue+a+Pull+Request">Issue a Pull Request</h3>

<p>Navigate to the <a href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a>
repository you just pushed to (e.g. <a
href="https://github.com/your-user-name/rails">github.com/your-user-name/rails</a>)
and press “Pull Request” in the upper right hand corner.</p>

<p>Write your branch name in the branch field (this is filled with “master” by
default) and press “Update Commit Range”.</p>

<p>Ensure the changesets you introduced are included in the “Commits” tab.
Ensure that the “Files Changed” incorporate all of your changes.</p>

<p>Fill in some details about your potential patch including a meaningful
title. When finished, press “Send pull request”. The <a
href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> core team will be notified
about your submission.</p>

<h3 id="label-Get+some+Feedback">Get some Feedback</h3>

<p>Now you need to get other people to look at your patch, just as you&#39;ve
looked at other people&#39;s patches. You can use the <a
href="http://groups.google.com/group/rubyonrails-core/">rubyonrails-core
mailing list</a> or the rails-contrib channel on IRC freenode for this. You
might also try just talking to <a
href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> developers that you know.</p>

<h3 id="label-Iterate+as+Necessary">Iterate as Necessary</h3>

<p>It’s entirely possible that the feedback you get will suggest changes.
Don’t get discouraged: the whole point of contributing to an active open
source project is to tap into community knowledge. If people are
encouraging you to tweak your code, then it’s worth making the tweaks and
resubmitting. If the feedback is that your code doesn’t belong in the core,
you might still think about releasing it as a gem.</p>

<h4 id="label-Squashing+commits">Squashing commits</h4>

<p><a href="../../../../classes/One.html">One</a> of the things that we may
ask you to do is “squash your commits,” which will combine all of your
commits into a single commit. We prefer pull requests that are a single
commit. This makes it easier to backport changes to stable branches,
squashing makes it easier to revert bad commits, and the git history can be
a bit easier to follow. <a href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a>
is a large project, and a bunch of extraneous commits can add a lot of
noise.</p>

<p>In order to do this, you&#39;ll need to have a git remote that points at
the main <a href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> repository.
This is useful anyway, but just in case you don&#39;t have it set up, make
sure that you do this first:</p>

<pre><code>$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/rails/rails.git</code></pre>

<p>You can call this remote whatever you&#39;d like, but if you don&#39;t use
<code>upstream</code>, then change the name to your own in the instructions
below.</p>

<p>Given that your remote branch is called <code>my_pull_request</code>, then
you can do the following:</p>

<pre><code>$ git fetch upstream
$ git checkout my_pull_request
$ git rebase upstream/master
$ git rebase -i

&lt; Choose &#39;squash&#39; for all of your commits except the first one. &gt;
&lt; Edit the commit message to make sense, and describe all your changes. &gt;

$ git push origin my_pull_request -f</code></pre>

<p>You should be able to refresh the pull request on GitHub and see that it
has been updated.</p>

<h3 id="label-Backporting">Backporting</h3>

<p>Changes that are merged into master are intended for the next major release
of <a href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a>. Sometimes, it might
be beneficial for your changes to propagate back to the maintenance
releases for older stable branches. Generally, security fixes and bug fixes
are good candidates for a backport, while new features and patches that
introduce a change in behavior will not be accepted. When in doubt, it is
best to consult a <a href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> team
member before backporting your changes to avoid wasted effort.</p>

<p>For simple fixes, the easiest way to backport your changes is to <a
href="http://ariejan.net/2009/10/26/how-to-create-and-apply-a-patch-with-git">extract
a diff from your changes in master and apply them to the target branch</a>.</p>

<p>First make sure your changes are the only difference between your current
branch and master:</p>

<pre><code>$ git log master..HEAD</code></pre>

<p>Then extract the diff:</p>

<pre><code>$ git format-patch master --stdout &gt; ~/my_changes.patch</code></pre>

<p>Switch over to the target branch and apply your changes:</p>

<pre><code>$ git checkout -b my_backport_branch 3-2-stable
$ git apply ~/my_changes.patch</code></pre>

<p>This works well for simple changes. However, if your changes are
complicated or if the code in master has deviated significantly from your
target branch, it might require more work on your part. The difficulty of a
backport varies greatly from case to case, and sometimes it is simply not
worth the effort.</p>

<p>Once you have resolved all conflicts and made sure all the tests are
passing, push your changes and open a separate pull request for your
backport. It is also worth noting that older branches might have a
different set of build targets than master. When possible, it is best to
first test your backport locally against the Ruby versions listed in
<code>.travis.yml</code> before submitting your pull request.</p>

<p>And then… think about your next contribution!</p>
