<h2 id="label-What+Does+a+Controller+Do%3F">What Does a Controller Do?</h2>

<p>Action Controller is the C in MVC. After routing has determined which
controller to use for a request, your controller is responsible for making
sense of the request and producing the appropriate output. Luckily, Action
Controller does most of the groundwork for you and uses smart conventions
to make this as straightforward as possible.</p>

<p>For most conventional <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">RESTful</a>
applications, the controller will receive the request (this is invisible to
you as the developer), fetch or save data from a model and use a view to
create <a href="../../../../classes/HTML.html">HTML</a> output. If your
controller needs to do things a little differently, that&#39;s not a
problem, this is just the most common way for a controller to work.</p>

<p><a href="../../../../classes/A.html">A</a> controller can thus be thought
of as a middle man between models and views. It makes the model data
available to the view so it can display that data to the user, and it saves
or updates data from the user to the model.</p>

<p>NOTE: For more details on the routing process, see <a
href="http://routing.html">Rails Routing from the Outside In</a>.</p>

<h2 id="label-Methods+and+Actions">Methods and Actions</h2>

<p><a href="../../../../classes/A.html">A</a> controller is a Ruby class which
inherits from <code>ApplicationController</code> and has methods just like
any other class. When your application receives a request, the routing will
determine which controller and action to run, then <a
href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> creates an instance of that
controller and runs the method with the same name as the action.</p>

<pre><code>class ClientsController &lt; ApplicationController
  def new
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>As an example, if a user goes to <code>/clients/new</code> in your
application to add a new client, <a
href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> will create an instance of
<code>ClientsController</code> and run the <code>new</code> method. Note
that the empty method from the example above could work just fine because
<a href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> will by default render
the <code>new.html.erb</code> view unless the action says otherwise. The
<code>new</code> method could make available to the view a
<code>@client</code> instance variable by creating a new
<code>Client</code>:</p>

<pre><code>def new
  @client = Client.new
end
</code></pre>

<p>The <a href="http://layouts_and_rendering.html">Layouts & Rendering
Guide</a> explains this in more detail.</p>

<p><code>ApplicationController</code> inherits from
<code>ActionController::Base</code>, which defines a number of helpful
methods. This guide will cover some of these, but if you&#39;re curious to
see what&#39;s in there, you can see all of them in the API documentation
or in the source itself.</p>

<p>Only public methods are callable as actions. It is a best practice to lower
the visibility of methods which are not intended to be actions, like
auxiliary methods or filters.</p>

<h2 id="label-Parameters">Parameters</h2>

<p>You will probably want to access data sent in by the user or other
parameters in your controller actions. There are two kinds of parameters
possible in a web application. The first are parameters that are sent as
part of the URL, called query string parameters. The query string is
everything after “?” in the URL. The second type of parameter is usually
referred to as POST data. This information usually comes from an <a
href="../../../../classes/HTML.html">HTML</a> form which has been filled in
by the user. It&#39;s called POST data because it can only be sent as part
of an HTTP POST request. <a href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a>
does not make any distinction between query string parameters and POST
parameters, and both are available in the <code>params</code> hash in your
controller:</p>

<pre><code>class ClientsController &lt; ApplicationController
  # This action uses query string parameters because it gets run
  # by an HTTP GET request, but this does not make any difference
  # to the way in which the parameters are accessed. The URL for
  # this action would look like this in order to list activated
  # clients: /clients?status=activated
  def index
    if params[:status] == &quot;activated&quot;
      @clients = Client.activated
    else
      @clients = Client.inactivated
    end
  end

  # This action uses POST parameters. They are most likely coming
  # from an HTML form which the user has submitted. The URL for
  # this RESTful request will be &quot;/clients&quot;, and the data will be
  # sent as part of the request body.
  def create
    @client = Client.new(params[:client])
    if @client.save
      redirect_to @client
    else
      # This line overrides the default rendering behavior, which
      # would have been to render the &quot;create&quot; view.
      render &quot;new&quot;
    end
  end
end
</code></pre>

<h3 id="label-Hash+and+Array+Parameters"><a href="../../../../classes/Hash.html">Hash</a> and <a href="../../../../classes/Array.html">Array</a> Parameters</h3>

<p>The <code>params</code> hash is not limited to one-dimensional keys and
values. It can contain arrays and (nested) hashes. To send an array of
values, append an empty pair of square brackets “[]” to the key name:</p>

<pre><code>GET /clients?ids[]=1&amp;ids[]=2&amp;ids[]=3</code></pre>

<p>NOTE: The actual URL in this example will be encoded as
“/clients?ids%5b%5d=1&amp;ids%5b%5d=2&amp;ids%5b%5d=3” as “[” and “]” are
not allowed in URLs. Most of the time you don&#39;t have to worry about
this because the browser will take care of it for you, and <a
href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> will decode it back when it
receives it, but if you ever find yourself having to send those requests to
the server manually you have to keep this in mind.</p>

<p>The value of <code>params[:ids]</code> will now be <code>[&quot;1&quot;,
&quot;2&quot;, &quot;3&quot;]</code>. Note that parameter values are always
strings; <a href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> makes no
attempt to guess or cast the type.</p>

<p>To send a hash you include the key name inside the brackets:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form accept-charset=&quot;UTF-8&quot; action=&quot;/clients&quot; method=&quot;post&quot;&gt;
  &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;client[name]&quot; value=&quot;Acme&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;client[phone]&quot; value=&quot;12345&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;client[address][postcode]&quot; value=&quot;12345&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;client[address][city]&quot; value=&quot;Carrot City&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;</code></pre>

<p>When this form is submitted, the value of <code>params[:client]</code> will
be <code>{&quot;name&quot; =&gt; &quot;Acme&quot;, &quot;phone&quot; =&gt;
&quot;12345&quot;, &quot;address&quot; =&gt; {&quot;postcode&quot; =&gt;
&quot;12345&quot;, &quot;city&quot; =&gt; &quot;Carrot City&quot;}}</code>.
Note the nested hash in <code>params[:client][:address]</code>.</p>

<p>Note that the <code>params</code> hash is actually an instance of
<code>ActiveSupport::HashWithIndifferentAccess</code>, which acts like a
hash that lets you use symbols and strings interchangeably as keys.</p>

<h3 id="label-JSON+parameters">JSON parameters</h3>

<p>If you&#39;re writing a web service application, you might find yourself
more comfortable on accepting parameters in JSON format. <a
href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> will automatically convert
your parameters into <code>params</code> hash, which you&#39;ll be able to
access like you would normally do with form data.</p>

<p>So for example, if you are sending this JSON parameter:</p>

<pre><code>{ &quot;company&quot;: { &quot;name&quot;: &quot;acme&quot;, &quot;address&quot;: &quot;123 Carrot Street&quot; } }</code></pre>

<p>You&#39;ll get <code>params[:company]</code> as <code>{ :name =&gt;
&quot;acme&quot;, &quot;address&quot; =&gt; &quot;123 Carrot Street&quot;
}</code>.</p>

<p>Also, if you&#39;ve turned on <code>config.wrap_parameters</code> in your
initializer or calling <code>wrap_parameters</code> in your controller, you
can safely omit the root element in the JSON parameter. The parameters will
be cloned and wrapped in the key according to your controller&#39;s name by
default. So the above parameter can be written as:</p>

<pre><code>{ &quot;name&quot;: &quot;acme&quot;, &quot;address&quot;: &quot;123 Carrot Street&quot; }</code></pre>

<p>And assume that you&#39;re sending the data to
<code>CompaniesController</code>, it would then be wrapped in
<code>:company</code> key like this:</p>

<pre><code>{ :name =&gt; &quot;acme&quot;, :address =&gt; &quot;123 Carrot Street&quot;, :company =&gt; { :name =&gt; &quot;acme&quot;, :address =&gt; &quot;123 Carrot Street&quot; }}
</code></pre>

<p>You can customize the name of the key or specific parameters you want to
wrap by consulting the <a
href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionController/ParamsWrapper.html">API
documentation</a></p>

<p>NOTE: <a href="../../../../classes/A.html">A</a> support for parsing XML
parameters has been extracted into a gem named
<code>actionpack-xml_parser</code></p>

<h3 id="label-Routing+Parameters">Routing Parameters</h3>

<p>The <code>params</code> hash will always contain the
<code>:controller</code> and <code>:action</code> keys, but you should use
the methods <code>controller_name</code> and <code>action_name</code>
instead to access these values. Any other parameters defined by the
routing, such as <code>:id</code> will also be available. As an example,
consider a listing of clients where the list can show either active or
inactive clients. We can add a route which captures the
<code>:status</code> parameter in a “pretty” URL:</p>

<pre><code>match &#39;/clients/:status&#39; =&gt; &#39;clients#index&#39;, foo: &quot;bar&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>In this case, when a user opens the URL <code>/clients/active</code>,
<code>params[:status]</code> will be set to “active”. When this route is
used, <code>params[:foo]</code> will also be set to “bar” just like it was
passed in the query string. In the same way <code>params[:action]</code>
will contain “index”.</p>

<h3 id="label-default_url_options"><code>default_url_options</code></h3>

<p>You can set global default parameters for URL generation by defining a
method called <code>default_url_options</code> in your controller. Such a
method must return a hash with the desired defaults, whose keys must be
symbols:</p>

<pre><code>class ApplicationController &lt; ActionController::Base
  def default_url_options
    { locale: I18n.locale }
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>These options will be used as a starting point when generating URLs, so
it&#39;s possible they&#39;ll be overridden by the options passed in
<code>url_for</code> calls.</p>

<p>If you define <code>default_url_options</code> in
<code>ApplicationController</code>, as in the example above, it would be
used for all URL generation. The method can also be defined in one specific
controller, in which case it only affects URLs generated there.</p>

<h2 id="label-Session"><a href="../../../../classes/Session.html">Session</a></h2>

<p>Your application has a session for each user in which you can store small
amounts of data that will be persisted between requests. The session is
only available in the controller and the view and can use one of a number
of different storage mechanisms:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><code>ActionDispatch::Session::CookieStore</code> - Stores everything on
the client.</p>
</li><li>
<p><code>ActionDispatch::Session::CacheStore</code> - Stores the data in the
<a href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> cache.</p>
</li><li>
<p><code>ActionDispatch::Session::ActiveRecordStore</code> - Stores the data
in a database using Active Record. (require
<code>activerecord-session_store</code> gem).</p>
</li><li>
<p><code>ActionDispatch::Session::MemCacheStore</code> - Stores the data in a
memcached cluster (this is a legacy implementation; consider using
CacheStore instead).</p>
</li></ul>

<p>All session stores use a cookie to store a unique ID for each session (you
must use a cookie, <a href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> will
not allow you to pass the session ID in the URL as this is less secure).</p>

<p>For most stores, this ID is used to look up the session data on the server,
e.g. in a database table. There is one exception, and that is the default
and recommended session store - the CookieStore - which stores all session
data in the cookie itself (the ID is still available to you if you need
it). This has the advantage of being very lightweight and it requires zero
setup in a new application in order to use the session. The cookie data is
cryptographically signed to make it tamper-proof, but it is not encrypted,
so anyone with access to it can read its contents but not edit it (Rails
will not accept it if it has been edited).</p>

<p>The CookieStore can store around 4kB of data — much less than the others —
but this is usually enough. Storing large amounts of data in the session is
discouraged no matter which session store your application uses. You should
especially avoid storing complex objects (anything other than basic Ruby
objects, the most common example being model instances) in the session, as
the server might not be able to reassemble them between requests, which
will result in an error.</p>

<p>If your user sessions don&#39;t store critical data or don&#39;t need to be
around for long periods (for instance if you just use the flash for
messaging), you can consider using <a
href="../../../../classes/ActionDispatch/Session/CacheStore.html">ActionDispatch::Session::CacheStore</a>.
This will store sessions using the cache implementation you have configured
for your application. The advantage of this is that you can use your
existing cache infrastructure for storing sessions without requiring any
additional setup or administration. The downside, of course, is that the
sessions will be ephemeral and could disappear at any time.</p>

<p>Read more about session storage in the <a
href="http://security.html">Security Guide</a>.</p>

<p>If you need a different session storage mechanism, you can change it in the
<code>config/initializers/session_store.rb</code> file:</p>

<pre><code># Use the database for sessions instead of the cookie-based default,
# which shouldn&#39;t be used to store highly confidential information
# (create the session table with &quot;rails g active_record:session_migration&quot;)
# YourApp::Application.config.session_store :active_record_store
</code></pre>

<p><a href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> sets up a session key
(the name of the cookie) when signing the session data. These can also be
changed in <code>config/initializers/session_store.rb</code>:</p>

<pre><code># Be sure to restart your server when you modify this file.
YourApp::Application.config.session_store :cookie_store, key: &#39;_your_app_session&#39;
</code></pre>

<p>You can also pass a <code>:domain</code> key and specify the domain name
for the cookie:</p>

<pre><code># Be sure to restart your server when you modify this file.
YourApp::Application.config.session_store :cookie_store, key: &#39;_your_app_session&#39;, domain: &quot;.example.com&quot;
</code></pre>

<p><a href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> sets up (for the
CookieStore) a secret key used for signing the session data. This can be
changed in <code>config/initializers/secret_token.rb</code></p>

<pre><code># Be sure to restart your server when you modify this file.

# Your secret key for verifying the integrity of signed cookies.
# If you change this key, all old signed cookies will become invalid!
# Make sure the secret is at least 30 characters and all random,
# no regular words or you&#39;ll be exposed to dictionary attacks.
YourApp::Application.config.secret_key_base = &#39;49d3f3de9ed86c74b94ad6bd0...&#39;
</code></pre>

<p>NOTE: Changing the secret when using the <code>CookieStore</code> will
invalidate all existing sessions.</p>

<h3 id="label-Accessing+the+Session">Accessing the <a href="../../../../classes/Session.html">Session</a></h3>

<p>In your controller you can access the session through the
<code>session</code> instance method.</p>

<p>NOTE: Sessions are lazily loaded. If you don&#39;t access sessions in your
action&#39;s code, they will not be loaded. Hence you will never need to
disable sessions, just not accessing them will do the job.</p>

<p><a href="../../../../classes/Session.html">Session</a> values are stored
using key/value pairs like a hash:</p>

<pre><code>class ApplicationController &lt; ActionController::Base

  private

  # Finds the User with the ID stored in the session with the key
  # :current_user_id This is a common way to handle user login in
  # a Rails application; logging in sets the session value and
  # logging out removes it.
  def current_user
    @_current_user ||= session[:current_user_id] &amp;&amp;
      User.find_by_id(session[:current_user_id])
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>To store something in the session, just assign it to the key like a hash:</p>

<pre><code>class LoginsController &lt; ApplicationController
  # &quot;Create&quot; a login, aka &quot;log the user in&quot;
  def create
    if user = User.authenticate(params[:username], params[:password])
      # Save the user ID in the session so it can be used in
      # subsequent requests
      session[:current_user_id] = user.id
      redirect_to root_url
    end
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>To remove something from the session, assign that key to be
<code>nil</code>:</p>

<pre><code>class LoginsController &lt; ApplicationController
  # &quot;Delete&quot; a login, aka &quot;log the user out&quot;
  def destroy
    # Remove the user id from the session
    @_current_user = session[:current_user_id] = nil
    redirect_to root_url
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>To reset the entire session, use <code>reset_session</code>.</p>

<h3 id="label-The+Flash">The Flash</h3>

<p>The flash is a special part of the session which is cleared with each
request. This means that values stored there will only be available in the
next request, which is useful for passing error messages etc.</p>

<p>It is accessed in much the same way as the session, as a hash (it&#39;s a
<a
href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionDispatch/Flash/FlashHash.html">FlashHash</a>
instance).</p>

<p>Let&#39;s use the act of logging out as an example. The controller can send
a message which will be displayed to the user on the next request:</p>

<pre><code>class LoginsController &lt; ApplicationController
  def destroy
    session[:current_user_id] = nil
    flash[:notice] = &quot;You have successfully logged out.&quot;
    redirect_to root_url
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Note that it is also possible to assign a flash message as part of the
redirection. You can assign <code>:notice</code>, <code>:alert</code> or
the general purpose <code>:flash</code>:</p>

<pre><code>redirect_to root_url, notice: &quot;You have successfully logged out.&quot;
redirect_to root_url, alert: &quot;You&#39;re stuck here!&quot;
redirect_to root_url, flash: { referral_code: 1234 }
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>destroy</code> action redirects to the application&#39;s
<code>root_url</code>, where the message will be displayed. Note that
it&#39;s entirely up to the next action to decide what, if anything, it
will do with what the previous action put in the flash. It&#39;s
conventional to display any error alerts or notices from the flash in the
application&#39;s layout:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;!-- &lt;head/&gt; --&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;% flash.each do |name, msg| -%&gt;
      &lt;%= content_tag :div, msg, class: name %&gt;
    &lt;% end -%&gt;

    &lt;!-- more content --&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>

<p>This way, if an action sets a notice or an alert message, the layout will
display it automatically.</p>

<p>You can pass anything that the session can store; you&#39;re not limited to
notices and alerts:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;% if flash[:just_signed_up] %&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;welcome&quot;&gt;Welcome to our site!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;</code></pre>

<p>If you want a flash value to be carried over to another request, use the
<code>keep</code> method:</p>

<pre><code>class MainController &lt; ApplicationController
  # Let&#39;s say this action corresponds to root_url, but you want
  # all requests here to be redirected to UsersController#index.
  # If an action sets the flash and redirects here, the values
  # would normally be lost when another redirect happens, but you
  # can use &#39;keep&#39; to make it persist for another request.
  def index
    # Will persist all flash values.
    flash.keep

    # You can also use a key to keep only some kind of value.
    # flash.keep(:notice)
    redirect_to users_url
  end
end
</code></pre>

<h4 id="label-flash.now"><code>flash.now</code></h4>

<p>By default, adding values to the flash will make them available to the next
request, but sometimes you may want to access those values in the same
request. For example, if the <code>create</code> action fails to save a
resource and you render the <code>new</code> template directly, that&#39;s
not going to result in a new request, but you may still want to display a
message using the flash. To do this, you can use <code>flash.now</code> in
the same way you use the normal <code>flash</code>:</p>

<pre><code>class ClientsController &lt; ApplicationController
  def create
    @client = Client.new(params[:client])
    if @client.save
      # ...
    else
      flash.now[:error] = &quot;Could not save client&quot;
      render action: &quot;new&quot;
    end
  end
end
</code></pre>

<h2 id="label-Cookies">Cookies</h2>

<p>Your application can store small amounts of data on the client — called
cookies — that will be persisted across requests and even sessions. <a
href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> provides easy access to
cookies via the <code>cookies</code> method, which — much like the
<code>session</code> — works like a hash:</p>

<pre><code>class CommentsController &lt; ApplicationController
  def new
    # Auto-fill the commenter&#39;s name if it has been stored in a cookie
    @comment = Comment.new(author: cookies[:commenter_name])
  end

  def create
    @comment = Comment.new(params[:comment])
    if @comment.save
      flash[:notice] = &quot;Thanks for your comment!&quot;
      if params[:remember_name]
        # Remember the commenter&#39;s name.
        cookies[:commenter_name] = @comment.author
      else
        # Delete cookie for the commenter&#39;s name cookie, if any.
        cookies.delete(:commenter_name)
      end
      redirect_to @comment.article
    else
      render action: &quot;new&quot;
    end
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Note that while for session values you set the key to <code>nil</code>, to
delete a cookie value you should use <code>cookies.delete(:key)</code>.</p>

<h2 id="label-Rendering+xml+and+json+data">Rendering xml and json data</h2>

<p><a href="../../../../classes/ActionController.html">ActionController</a>
makes it extremely easy to render <code>xml</code> or <code>json</code>
data. If you generate a controller using scaffolding then it would look
something like this:</p>

<pre><code>class UsersController &lt; ApplicationController
  def index
    @users = User.all
    respond_to do |format|
      format.html # index.html.erb
      format.xml  { render xml: @users}
      format.json { render json: @users}
    end
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that in the above case code is <code>render xml: @users</code> and
not <code>render xml: @users.to_xml</code>. That is because if the input is
not string then rails automatically invokes <code>to_xml</code> .</p>

<h2 id="label-Filters">Filters</h2>

<p>Filters are methods that are run before, after or “around” a controller
action.</p>

<p>Filters are inherited, so if you set a filter on
<code>ApplicationController</code>, it will be run on every controller in
your application.</p>

<p>“Before” filters may halt the request cycle. <a
href="../../../../classes/A.html">A</a> common “before” filter is one which
requires that a user is logged in for an action to be run. You can define
the filter method this way:</p>

<pre><code>class ApplicationController &lt; ActionController::Base
  before_action :require_login

  private

  def require_login
    unless logged_in?
      flash[:error] = &quot;You must be logged in to access this section&quot;
      redirect_to new_login_url # halts request cycle
    end
  end

  # The logged_in? method simply returns true if the user is logged
  # in and false otherwise. It does this by &quot;booleanizing&quot; the
  # current_user method we created previously using a double ! operator.
  # Note that this is not common in Ruby and is discouraged unless you
  # really mean to convert something into true or false.
  def logged_in?
    !!current_user
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>The method simply stores an error message in the flash and redirects to the
login form if the user is not logged in. If a “before” filter renders or
redirects, the action will not run. If there are additional filters
scheduled to run after that filter, they are also cancelled.</p>

<p>In this example the filter is added to <code>ApplicationController</code>
and thus all controllers in the application inherit it. This will make
everything in the application require the user to be logged in in order to
use it. For obvious reasons (the user wouldn&#39;t be able to log in in the
first place!), not all controllers or actions should require this. You can
prevent this filter from running before particular actions with
<code>skip_before_action</code>:</p>

<pre><code>class LoginsController &lt; ApplicationController
  skip_before_action :require_login, only: [:new, :create]
end
</code></pre>

<p>Now, the <code>LoginsController</code>&#39;s <code>new</code> and
<code>create</code> actions will work as before without requiring the user
to be logged in. The <code>:only</code> option is used to only skip this
filter for these actions, and there is also an <code>:except</code> option
which works the other way. These options can be used when adding filters
too, so you can add a filter which only runs for selected actions in the
first place.</p>

<h3 id="label-After+Filters+and+Around+Filters">After Filters and Around Filters</h3>

<p>In addition to “before” filters, you can also run filters after an action
has been executed, or both before and after.</p>

<p>“After” filters are similar to “before” filters, but because the action has
already been run they have access to the response data that&#39;s about to
be sent to the client. Obviously, “after” filters cannot stop the action
from running.</p>

<p>“Around” filters are responsible for running their associated actions by
yielding, similar to how <a href="../../../../classes/Rack.html">Rack</a>
middlewares work.</p>

<p>For example, in a website where changes have an approval workflow an
administrator could be able to preview them easily, just apply them within
a transaction:</p>

<pre><code>class ChangesController &lt; ApplicationController
  around_action :wrap_in_transaction, only: :show

  private

  def wrap_in_transaction
    ActiveRecord::Base.transaction do
      begin
        yield
      ensure
        raise ActiveRecord::Rollback
      end
    end
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Note that an “around” filter also wraps rendering. In particular, if in the
example above, the view itself reads from the database (e.g. via a scope),
it will do so within the transaction and thus present the data to preview.</p>

<p>You can choose not to yield and build the response yourself, in which case
the action will not be run.</p>

<h3 id="label-Other+Ways+to+Use+Filters">Other Ways to Use Filters</h3>

<p>While the most common way to use filters is by creating private methods and
using *_action to add them, there are two other ways to do the same thing.</p>

<p>The first is to use a block directly with the *_action methods. The block
receives the controller as an argument, and the <code>require_login</code>
filter from above could be rewritten to use a block:</p>

<pre><code>class ApplicationController &lt; ActionController::Base
  before_action do |controller|
    redirect_to new_login_url unless controller.send(:logged_in?)
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the filter in this case uses <code>send</code> because the
<code>logged_in?</code> method is private and the filter is not run in the
scope of the controller. This is not the recommended way to implement this
particular filter, but in more simple cases it might be useful.</p>

<p>The second way is to use a class (actually, any object that responds to the
right methods will do) to handle the filtering. This is useful in cases
that are more complex and can not be implemented in a readable and reusable
way using the two other methods. As an example, you could rewrite the login
filter again to use a class:</p>

<pre><code>class ApplicationController &lt; ActionController::Base
  before_action LoginFilter
end

class LoginFilter
  def self.filter(controller)
    unless controller.send(:logged_in?)
      controller.flash[:error] = &quot;You must be logged in&quot;
      controller.redirect_to controller.new_login_url
    end
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Again, this is not an ideal example for this filter, because it&#39;s not
run in the scope of the controller but gets the controller passed as an
argument. The filter class has a class method <code>filter</code> which
gets run before or after the action, depending on if it&#39;s a before or
after filter. Classes used as around filters can also use the same
<code>filter</code> method, which will get run in the same way. The method
must <code>yield</code> to execute the action. Alternatively, it can have
both a <code>before</code> and an <code>after</code> method that are run
before and after the action.</p>

<h2 id="label-Request+Forgery+Protection">Request Forgery Protection</h2>

<p>Cross-site request forgery is a type of attack in which a site tricks a
user into making requests on another site, possibly adding, modifying or
deleting data on that site without the user&#39;s knowledge or permission.</p>

<p>The first step to avoid this is to make sure all “destructive” actions
(create, update and destroy) can only be accessed with non-GET requests. If
you&#39;re following RESTful conventions you&#39;re already doing this.
However, a malicious site can still send a non-GET request to your site
quite easily, and that&#39;s where the request forgery protection comes in.
As the name says, it protects from forged requests.</p>

<p>The way this is done is to add a non-guessable token which is only known to
your server to each request. This way, if a request comes in without the
proper token, it will be denied access.</p>

<p>If you generate a form like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;%= form_for @user do |f| %&gt;
  &lt;%= f.text_field :username %&gt;
  &lt;%= f.text_field :password %&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;</code></pre>

<p>You will see how the token gets added as a hidden field:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form accept-charset=&quot;UTF-8&quot; action=&quot;/users/1&quot; method=&quot;post&quot;&gt;
&lt;input type=&quot;hidden&quot;
       value=&quot;67250ab105eb5ad10851c00a5621854a23af5489&quot;
       name=&quot;authenticity_token&quot;/&gt;
&lt;!-- fields --&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;</code></pre>

<p><a href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> adds this token to every
form that&#39;s generated using the <a href="http://form_helpers.html">form
helpers</a>, so most of the time you don&#39;t have to worry about it. If
you&#39;re writing a form manually or need to add the token for another
reason, it&#39;s available through the method
<code>form_authenticity_token</code>:</p>

<p>The <code>form_authenticity_token</code> generates a valid authentication
token. That&#39;s useful in places where <a
href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> does not add it
automatically, like in custom Ajax calls.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://security.html">Security Guide</a> has more about this
and a lot of other security-related issues that you should be aware of when
developing a web application.</p>

<h2 id="label-The+Request+and+Response+Objects">The Request and Response Objects</h2>

<p>In every controller there are two accessor methods pointing to the request
and the response objects associated with the request cycle that is
currently in execution. The <code>request</code> method contains an
instance of <code>AbstractRequest</code> and the <code>response</code>
method returns a response object representing what is going to be sent back
to the client.</p>

<h3 id="label-The+request+Object">The <code>request</code> <a href="../../../../classes/Object.html">Object</a></h3>

<p>The request object contains a lot of useful information about the request
coming in from the client. To get a full list of the available methods,
refer to the <a
href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionDispatch/Request.html">API
documentation</a>. Among the properties that you can access on this object
are:</p>

<p>| Property of <code>request</code> | Purpose | | —————————————– |
——————————————————————————– | | host | The hostname used for this request.
| | domain(n=2) | The hostname&#39;s first <code>n</code> segments,
starting from the right (the TLD). | | format | The content type requested
by the client. | | method | The HTTP method used for the request. | | get?,
post?, patch?, put?, delete?, head? | Returns true if the HTTP method is
GET/POST/PATCH/PUT/DELETE/HEAD. | | headers | Returns a hash containing the
headers associated with the request. | | port | The port number (integer)
used for the request. | | protocol | Returns a string containing the
protocol used plus “://”, for example “http://”. | | query_string | The
query string part of the URL, i.e., everything after “?”. | | remote_ip |
The IP address of the client. | | url | The entire URL used for the
request. |</p>

<h4 id="label-path_parameters%2C+query_parameters%2C+and+request_parameters"><code>path_parameters</code>, <code>query_parameters</code>, and <code>request_parameters</code></h4>

<p><a href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> collects all of the
parameters sent along with the request in the <code>params</code> hash,
whether they are sent as part of the query string or the post body. The
request object has three accessors that give you access to these parameters
depending on where they came from. The <code>query_parameters</code> hash
contains parameters that were sent as part of the query string while the
<code>request_parameters</code> hash contains parameters sent as part of
the post body. The <code>path_parameters</code> hash contains parameters
that were recognized by the routing as being part of the path leading to
this particular controller and action.</p>

<h3 id="label-The+response+Object">The <code>response</code> <a href="../../../../classes/Object.html">Object</a></h3>

<p>The response object is not usually used directly, but is built up during
the execution of the action and rendering of the data that is being sent
back to the user, but sometimes - like in an after filter - it can be
useful to access the response directly. Some of these accessor methods also
have setters, allowing you to change their values.</p>

<p>| Property of <code>response</code> | Purpose | | ———————- |
————————————————————————————————— | | body | This is the string of data
being sent back to the client. This is most often <a
href="../../../../classes/HTML.html">HTML</a>. | | status | The HTTP status
code for the response, like 200 for a successful request or 404 for file
not found. | | location | The URL the client is being redirected to, if
any. | | content_type | The content type of the response. | | charset | The
character set being used for the response. <a
href="../../../../classes/Default.html">Default</a> is “utf-8”. | | headers
| Headers used for the response. |</p>

<h4 id="label-Setting+Custom+Headers">Setting <a href="../../../../classes/Custom.html">Custom</a> Headers</h4>

<p>If you want to set custom headers for a response then
<code>response.headers</code> is the place to do it. The headers attribute
is a hash which maps header names to their values, and <a
href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> will set some of them
automatically. If you want to add or change a header, just assign it to
<code>response.headers</code> this way:</p>

<pre><code>response.headers[&quot;Content-Type&quot;] = &quot;application/pdf&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>Note: in the above case it would make more sense to use the
<code>content_type</code> setter directly.</p>

<h2 id="label-HTTP+Authentications">HTTP Authentications</h2>

<p><a href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> comes with two built-in
HTTP authentication mechanisms:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Basic Authentication</p>
</li><li>
<p>Digest Authentication</p>
</li></ul>

<h3 id="label-HTTP+Basic+Authentication">HTTP Basic Authentication</h3>

<p>HTTP basic authentication is an authentication scheme that is supported by
the majority of browsers and other HTTP clients. As an example, consider an
administration section which will only be available by entering a username
and a password into the browser&#39;s HTTP basic dialog window. Using the
built-in authentication is quite easy and only requires you to use one
method, <code>http_basic_authenticate_with</code>.</p>

<pre><code>class AdminController &lt; ApplicationController
  http_basic_authenticate_with name: &quot;humbaba&quot;, password: &quot;5baa61e4&quot;
end
</code></pre>

<p>With this in place, you can create namespaced controllers that inherit from
<code>AdminController</code>. The filter will thus be run for all actions
in those controllers, protecting them with HTTP basic authentication.</p>

<h3 id="label-HTTP+Digest+Authentication">HTTP Digest Authentication</h3>

<p>HTTP digest authentication is superior to the basic authentication as it
does not require the client to send an unencrypted password over the
network (though HTTP basic authentication is safe over HTTPS). Using digest
authentication with <a href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> is
quite easy and only requires using one method,
<code>authenticate_or_request_with_http_digest</code>.</p>

<pre><code>class AdminController &lt; ApplicationController
  USERS = { &quot;lifo&quot; =&gt; &quot;world&quot; }

  before_action :authenticate

  private

  def authenticate
    authenticate_or_request_with_http_digest do |username|
      USERS[username]
    end
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>As seen in the example above, the
<code>authenticate_or_request_with_http_digest</code> block takes only one
argument - the username. And the block returns the password. Returning
<code>false</code> or <code>nil</code> from the
<code>authenticate_or_request_with_http_digest</code> will cause
authentication failure.</p>

<h2 id="label-Streaming+and+File+Downloads">Streaming and <a href="../../../../classes/File.html">File</a> Downloads</h2>

<p>Sometimes you may want to send a file to the user instead of rendering an
<a href="../../../../classes/HTML.html">HTML</a> page. All controllers in
<a href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> have the
<code>send_data</code> and the <code>send_file</code> methods, which will
both stream data to the client. <code>send_file</code> is a convenience
method that lets you provide the name of a file on the disk and it will
stream the contents of that file for you.</p>

<p>To stream data to the client, use <code>send_data</code>:</p>

<pre><code>require &quot;prawn&quot;
class ClientsController &lt; ApplicationController
  # Generates a PDF document with information on the client and
  # returns it. The user will get the PDF as a file download.
  def download_pdf
    client = Client.find(params[:id])
    send_data generate_pdf(client),
              filename: &quot;#{client.name}.pdf&quot;,
              type: &quot;application/pdf&quot;
  end

  private

  def generate_pdf(client)
    Prawn::Document.new do
      text client.name, align: :center
      text &quot;Address: #{client.address}&quot;
      text &quot;Email: #{client.email}&quot;
    end.render
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>download_pdf</code> action in the example above will call a
private method which actually generates the PDF document and returns it as
a string. This string will then be streamed to the client as a file
download and a filename will be suggested to the user. Sometimes when
streaming files to the user, you may not want them to download the file.
Take images, for example, which can be embedded into <a
href="../../../../classes/HTML.html">HTML</a> pages. To tell the browser a
file is not meant to be downloaded, you can set the
<code>:disposition</code> option to “inline”. The opposite and default
value for this option is “attachment”.</p>

<h3 id="label-Sending+Files">Sending Files</h3>

<p>If you want to send a file that already exists on disk, use the
<code>send_file</code> method.</p>

<pre><code>class ClientsController &lt; ApplicationController
  # Stream a file that has already been generated and stored on disk.
  def download_pdf
    client = Client.find(params[:id])
    send_file(&quot;#{Rails.root}/files/clients/#{client.id}.pdf&quot;,
              filename: &quot;#{client.name}.pdf&quot;,
              type: &quot;application/pdf&quot;)
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>This will read and stream the file 4kB at the time, avoiding loading the
entire file into memory at once. You can turn off streaming with the
<code>:stream</code> option or adjust the block size with the
<code>:buffer_size</code> option.</p>

<p>If <code>:type</code> is not specified, it will be guessed from the file
extension specified in <code>:filename</code>. If the content type is not
registered for the extension, <code>application/octet-stream</code> will be
used.</p>

<p>WARNING: Be careful when using data coming from the client (params,
cookies, etc.) to locate the file on disk, as this is a security risk that
might allow someone to gain access to files they are not meant to.</p>

<p>TIP: It is not recommended that you stream static files through <a
href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> if you can instead keep
them in a public folder on your web server. It is much more efficient to
let the user download the file directly using Apache or another web server,
keeping the request from unnecessarily going through the whole <a
href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> stack.</p>

<h3 id="label-RESTful+Downloads">RESTful Downloads</h3>

<p>While <code>send_data</code> works just fine, if you are creating a RESTful
application having separate actions for file downloads is usually not
necessary. In REST terminology, the PDF file from the example above can be
considered just another representation of the client resource. <a
href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> provides an easy and quite
sleek way of doing “RESTful downloads”. Here&#39;s how you can rewrite the
example so that the PDF download is a part of the <code>show</code> action,
without any streaming:</p>

<pre><code>class ClientsController &lt; ApplicationController
  # The user can request to receive this resource as HTML or PDF.
  def show
    @client = Client.find(params[:id])

    respond_to do |format|
      format.html
      format.pdf { render pdf: generate_pdf(@client) }
    end
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>In order for this example to work, you have to add the PDF MIME type to <a
href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a>. This can be done by adding
the following line to the file
<code>config/initializers/mime_types.rb</code>:</p>

<pre><code>Mime::Type.register &quot;application/pdf&quot;, :pdf
</code></pre>

<p>NOTE: Configuration files are not reloaded on each request, so you have to
restart the server in order for their changes to take effect.</p>

<p>Now the user can request to get a PDF version of a client just by adding
“.pdf” to the URL:</p>

<pre><code>GET /clients/1.pdf</code></pre>

<h2 id="label-Log+Filtering">Log Filtering</h2>

<p><a href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> keeps a log file for
each environment in the <code>log</code> folder. These are extremely useful
when debugging what&#39;s actually going on in your application, but in a
live application you may not want every bit of information to be stored in
the log file.</p>

<h3 id="label-Parameters+Filtering">Parameters Filtering</h3>

<p>You can filter certain request parameters from your log files by appending
them to <code>config.filter_parameters</code> in the application
configuration. These parameters will be marked [FILTERED] in the log.</p>

<pre><code>config.filter_parameters &lt;&lt; :password
</code></pre>

<h3 id="label-Redirects+Filtering">Redirects Filtering</h3>

<p>Sometimes it&#39;s desirable to filter out from log files some sensible
locations your application is redirecting to. You can do that by using the
<code>config.filter_redirect</code> configuration option:</p>

<pre><code>config.filter_redirect &lt;&lt; &#39;s3.amazonaws.com&#39;
</code></pre>

<p>You can set it to a <a href="../../../../classes/String.html">String</a>, a
Regexp, or an array of both.</p>

<pre><code>config.filter_redirect.concat [&#39;s3.amazonaws.com&#39;, /private_path/]
</code></pre>

<p>Matching URLs will be marked as &#39;[FILTERED]&#39;.</p>

<h2 id="label-Rescue">Rescue</h2>

<p>Most likely your application is going to contain bugs or otherwise throw an
exception that needs to be handled. For example, if the user follows a link
to a resource that no longer exists in the database, Active Record will
throw the <code>ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound</code> exception.</p>

<p>Rails&#39; default exception handling displays a “500 Server Error” message
for all exceptions. If the request was made locally, a nice traceback and
some added information gets displayed so you can figure out what went wrong
and deal with it. If the request was remote <a
href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> will just display a simple
“500 Server Error” message to the user, or a “404 Not Found” if there was a
routing error or a record could not be found. Sometimes you might want to
customize how these errors are caught and how they&#39;re displayed to the
user. There are several levels of exception handling available in a <a
href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> application:</p>

<h3 id="label-The+Default+500+and+404+Templates">The <a href="../../../../classes/Default.html">Default</a> 500 and 404 Templates</h3>

<p>By default a production application will render either a 404 or a 500 error
message. These messages are contained in static <a
href="../../../../classes/HTML.html">HTML</a> files in the
<code>public</code> folder, in <code>404.html</code> and
<code>500.html</code> respectively. You can customize these files to add
some extra information and layout, but remember that they are static; i.e.
you can&#39;t use RHTML or layouts in them, just plain <a
href="../../../../classes/HTML.html">HTML</a>.</p>

<h3 id="label-rescue_from"><code>rescue_from</code></h3>

<p>If you want to do something a bit more elaborate when catching errors, you
can use <code>rescue_from</code>, which handles exceptions of a certain
type (or multiple types) in an entire controller and its subclasses.</p>

<p>When an exception occurs which is caught by a <code>rescue_from</code>
directive, the exception object is passed to the handler. The handler can
be a method or a <code>Proc</code> object passed to the <code>:with</code>
option. You can also use a block directly instead of an explicit
<code>Proc</code> object.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s how you can use <code>rescue_from</code> to intercept all
<code>ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound</code> errors and do something with
them.</p>

<pre><code>class ApplicationController &lt; ActionController::Base
  rescue_from ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound, with: :record_not_found

  private

  def record_not_found
    render text: &quot;404 Not Found&quot;, status: 404
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, this example is anything but elaborate and doesn&#39;t improve
on the default exception handling at all, but once you can catch all those
exceptions you&#39;re free to do whatever you want with them. For example,
you could create custom exception classes that will be thrown when a user
doesn&#39;t have access to a certain section of your application:</p>

<pre><code>class ApplicationController &lt; ActionController::Base
  rescue_from User::NotAuthorized, with: :user_not_authorized

  private

  def user_not_authorized
    flash[:error] = &quot;You don&#39;t have access to this section.&quot;
    redirect_to :back
  end
end

class ClientsController &lt; ApplicationController
  # Check that the user has the right authorization to access clients.
  before_action :check_authorization

  # Note how the actions don&#39;t have to worry about all the auth stuff.
  def edit
    @client = Client.find(params[:id])
  end

  private

  # If the user is not authorized, just throw the exception.
  def check_authorization
    raise User::NotAuthorized unless current_user.admin?
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>NOTE: Certain exceptions are only rescuable from the
<code>ApplicationController</code> class, as they are raised before the
controller gets initialized and the action gets executed. See Pratik
Naik&#39;s <a
href="http://m.onkey.org/2008/7/20/rescue-from-dispatching">article</a> on
the subject for more information.</p>

<h2 id="label-Force+HTTPS+protocol">Force HTTPS protocol</h2>

<p>Sometime you might want to force a particular controller to only be
accessible via an HTTPS protocol for security reasons. You can use the
<code>force_ssl</code> method in your controller to enforce that:</p>

<pre><code>class DinnerController
  force_ssl
end
</code></pre>

<p>Just like the filter, you could also pass <code>:only</code> and
<code>:except</code> to enforce the secure connection only to specific
actions:</p>

<pre><code>class DinnerController
  force_ssl only: :cheeseburger
  # or
  force_ssl except: :cheeseburger
end
</code></pre>

<p>Please note that if you find yourself adding <code>force_ssl</code> to many
controllers, you may want to force the whole application to use HTTPS
instead. In that case, you can set the <code>config.force_ssl</code> in
your environment file.</p>
